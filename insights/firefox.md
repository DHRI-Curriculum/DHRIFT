# Firefox

## What it is

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/) is a free to download web browser built by the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/about/), a non profit organization. Firefox allows users to access websites on the internet. 

## Why we use it

For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use Firefox because it works on Windows and Mac operating systems, it is frequently updated, and it values user privacy. 

## Installation instructions: macOS

### Step 1: Go to the Firefox download webpage

Visit the [Firefox download page](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=support.mozilla.org) in your pre-installed browser, such as Safari.

### Step 3: Move Firefox to the Applications folder

Once the download has finished, the file should open by itself and pop open a Finder window containing the Firefox application. Drag the Firefox icon on top of the Applications folder in order to copy it there. This action will begin the installation, which should only take a few seconds to complete.
