Filipa Calado is a Ph.D. candidate in English at the Graduate Center, CUNY. She is interested in digital tools that change the way we read and study 20th century queer literatures. Her dissertation takes a critical look at a variety of digital tools to analyze manuscripts, diaries, journals, and memoirs by queer writers. Here, she explores how digital methods can disrupt expectations about reading and analytical practices. She is a Digital Fellow for the GC Digital Initiatives, where she leads workshops on Python and Text Encoding with TEI, and works with the Digital Archive Research Collective. She teaches Latinx Literature at Hunter College, CUNY.
