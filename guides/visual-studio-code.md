# Microsoft Visual Studio Code

## What it is

Visual Studio Code is a text editor that allows us to write code in a variety of computational languages such as python, HTML, javascript, among others.

## Why we use it

For the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use Visual Studio Code because it supports [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting), it is free and built on open source, and it is consistent across Mac, Windows, and Linux systems.

## Installation instructions: macOS Catalina

### Step 1: Download Visual Studio Code Installer

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your internet browser, such as Firefox or Safari, and click `Download for Mac`. Then click `Save File` in the dialogue box that asks if you would like to save the file
