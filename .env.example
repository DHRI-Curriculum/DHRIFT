# GitHub Personal Access Token (for rate limits)
# Used for higher rate limits when fetching workshop content from GitHub API
# Without token: 60 requests/hour per IP
# With token: 5,000 requests/hour
#
# Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Permissions needed: public_repo (read-only for public repos)
#
# NOTE: NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix means this is bundled into client JavaScript
# Token will be visible in browser, but this is acceptable since:
# - All workshop repos are public anyway
# - It's a read-only token for public data
# - IndexedDB caching minimizes actual API calls
#
# In production (GitHub Actions), this is set via secrets.GITHUBKEY
# For local development, set this variable:
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUBSECRET=

# Alternative name (for backwards compatibility):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_TOKEN=

# Example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUBSECRET=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
