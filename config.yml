intro: "The Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) is an intensive, community-oriented, 
and foundational approach to learning technical skills in service of humanities teaching and 
learning. The DHRI curriculum features workshops, tutorials, glossaries, resources, reading 
materials, and more that have been developed at The Graduate Center, City University of New York 
since 2016. 


Part of a 2019 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) Office of 
Digital Humanities (ODH), DHRI's curriculum, which was originally developed for in-person workshops, 
was revised in Summer 2020 to better meet the needs of virtual instruction due to the covid-19 pandemic. 
While the curriculum has always been available openly on GitHub, this site creates a more 
user-friendly and functional interface that is open and free for public use."
