-   Accessibility: '


        Accessibility is "the quality or condition of being accessible (in various
        senses)," and "access" refers to "to obtain, acquire; to get hold of" or "to
        gain admission to" (source: Oxford English Dictionary online). "Accessibility"
        in design speak often refers to design for people with disabilities (see [Shawn
        Lawton Henry, et al. 2014](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2596695.2596719)).
        This workshop employs the term "accessibility" to refer to access to those
        folks as well as to people in different international contexts and/or who
        speak different languages, and to methods of open or non-proprietary design
        and sharing.

-   Attribute Table: '


        An *attribute* is a characteristic of a feature. Attributes can contain data
        of different types: strings (text), numerical values, dates, or booleans.
        Each column in the *Attribute Table* represents a different attribute.

        Attributes offer secondary information about an element in HTML. Each attribute
        is nestled within the element tag. For example, the HTML command `<a href="https://www.dhinstitutes.org/">Digital
        Humanities Research Institute</a>` contains a link to the Digital Humanities
        Research Institute website. Here, the `a` element denotes a hyperlink and
        the `href` denote an attribute that specifies the hyperlink''s destination.'

        Attributes can be stored as different data types, including strings (text),

        Branches are not used in the Git session in this curriculum, but are a frequently
        used feature of Git. A branch is an alternative timeline of commits, usually
        used to add a new feature or some other substantive change to a repository.
        Once the feature or change is complete, the branch can be reintegrated with
        the main timeline, which is usually called "master." The process of reintegration
        is referred to as "merging".

-   Command Line: '


        The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer. Another
        way of looking at it is that the command line is a program that accepts commands
        as text input and converts them into appropriate operating system functions.


        There are other words that can be used synonymously with "command line." Here
        are some of them:

        - _bash_ - the programming language used in the command line. (Yes, we tricked
        you, you''re already programming!) Short for "Born Again SHell," for reasons
        people on the internet will happily tell you about.

        - _the terminal_ - Particularly used to refer to the command line on macOS.
        This term made more sense when universities used mainframes and every computer
        was only a terminal.

        - _the shell_ - The part of an operating system that interacts with a human.
        Technically, anything you do in a graphical interface is also in a shell,
        but in practice this is just another synonym for the command line.

        - _cli_ - "command-line interface," this is a super technical term for the
        command line used to impress everyone around you.

        \ need to stage  the files, or tell Git, which files it should pay attention\
        \ to. Where are your changes? You use the command `git add` to point to them.\
        \ \n- Second, you create the version by committing the changes. You use the\
        \ command `git commit` to take the snapshot and add a label (the -m flag)\
        \ that can help you in returning to that version in the future.\n\nMaking\
        \ a commit is a lot like taking a photo. First, you have to decide who will\

        \ (the staging process). Once everyone is present and ready, you take the\
        \ picture, entering that moment into the permanent record (the commit process).\n\

        To provide consent is to actively provide permission or agree to something.

        (not deception), and be able to comprehend such information. In the context
        of a research study, per *The Belmont Report* guidelines, a person must also
        be informed of their right to volunteer or not to participate in the study,
        and of their right to withdraw from the study at any point. Ideally, consent
        would also be enthusiastically given (see [The Belmont Report](belmont.md)
