This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced \"gooey!\"). Today we're going to explore another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (macOS) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform.\n<Terminal />\n## Learning Objectives\n<JSInterpreter/>\n\n- Learn common commands to create files (`touch` and `echo`)\n- Learn commands to create directories (`mkdir`)\n- Navigate our file structure using change directory (`cd`), print working directory (`pwd`), and list (`ls`)\n- Move content from one place to another using redirects (`>`) and pipes (`|`)\n- Explore a comma separated values (.csv) dataset using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`\n- Search text files using the `grep` command\n- Create and sort cheat sheets for the commands we learn\n\n## Estimated time\n\n3 hours\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete the workshop, you will need:\n\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md) (recommended) You can use any plain text editor but for our purposes, Visual Studio Code (\"VS Code\") will be used.\n- [Git Bash](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/git.md) (required) If you're using Windows, you will need to follow the instructions to install so that we can work in the cross-platform Unix command line for this session. If you're using macOS, however, you do not need to take any action. The built-in Terminal application has all the functionality we need.\n- [Julia Evans's Bite Size Command Line](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/08/05/new-zine--bite-size-command-line/) (recommended) Julia Evans's comics explain in detail (while being fun!) some of the most central Unix command line tools. It's a great zine to have on your desk next to you for this workshop, and long after.\n- [Basic UNIX commands](http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html) (recommended) This is another list of commonly used commands in the command line. It's useful, but can be a little overwhelming if you don't have any exposure to these things beforehand. Don't worry, we will cover the most important ones in our Introduction to Command Line workshop!\n\n## Contexts\n\n### Pre-reading suggestions\n\n- [Neal Stephenson's \"In the Beginning... Was the Command Line\"](http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html) is a useful piece to grasp the relationship between (and the affordances of) the command line and the GUI.\n- [Douglas Rushkoff's *Program or Be Programmed*](https://rushkoff.com/books/program-or-be-programmed/) offers some reflections on how using the command line allows one to communicate in a less mediated way with their machines and the importance of doing so in the current technoscape.\n\n### Projects that use these skills\n\nMastering the command line will prove useful in a great number of projects. Most Python- and R-based projects will require you to have some knowledge of the command line. At a very basic level, you will be invoking a Python script and will be using values of command line arguments when creating and running your scripts.\n\n- The command line is useful for setting up installations of server-side software (or more advanced software-as-a-service software, sometimes acronymized as SaaS). [Omeka](http://www.omeka.org) is merely one example. The command line will allow you to navigate the file structure of your server. Commands like `ls`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `cd`, etc. are really important. For example, `grep` could help you find a plugin directory that you might have accidentally placed in the wrong location.\n- [Fair World 64: A Text-Based Game of the 1964–1965 World's Fair](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/3786/) A recent digital capstone project by Christofer Gass runs a Python script on the command line\n- [Awesome Bash](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash) A curated list of useful Bash scripts and resources.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n- \"The command line\" is laden with masculine and military metaphors, which is reflective of the history of computing and programming. As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun discusses in [\"On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge\" (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1162/1526381043320741), almost all computers (as in human computers) in the US during World War II were young women. Human computers received commands from analysts—predominantly men with the military—that they then had to interpret and act upon the machine. As Chun (p. 34) argued, \"computation depends on 'yes, sir' in response to short declarative sentences and imperatives that are in essence commands ... The command line is a mere operating system (OS) simulation.\" If commands are the ways in which a user communicates with machines, the command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- Current Author: [Stefano Morello](https://github.com/smorello87)\n- Past contributing Author: [Kelsey Chatlosh](https://github.com/kchatlosh)\n- Past contributing Author: [Patrick Smyth](https://github.com/smythp)\n- Past contributing Author: [Mary Catherine McKinniburgh](https://github.com/mckinniburgh)\n- Past contributing Author: [Jojo Karlin](https://github.com/jojokarlin/)\n- Past contributing Author: [Kalle Westerling](https://github.com/kallewesterling)\n- Past reviewer: [Di Yoong](https://github.com/dyoong)\n- Current editor: [Lisa Rhody](https://github.com/lmrhody)\n- Current editor: [Kalle Westerling](https://github.com/kallewesterling)\n\n# What Is the Command Line?\n\nThe command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer. You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them [in the glossary](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/command-line.md).) The shell we use (whether terminal, shell, or bash) is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions.\n\nThe command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.\n\n## What Does \"Text-based\" Mean?\n\nFor those of us comfortable reading and writing, the idea of \"text-based\" in the context of computers can seem a bit strange. As we start to get comfortable typing commands to the computer, it's important to distinguish \"text\" from word processed, desktop publishing. In the latter case, we use software (think Microsoft Word or Google Docs) that displays what we want to produce without showing us the code the computer is reading to render the formatting. On the other hand, while less pretty to look at, plain text has the advantage of being manipulable in different contexts.\n\nLet's take a quick moment to discuss text and text editors.\n\n# Text Editors\n\n## What is Text?\n\nBefore we explain which program we'll be using for editing text, we want to give a general sense of this \"text\" we keep mentioning. For those of us in the humanities, whether we follow literary theorists who read any object as a \"text\" or we dive into philology, paleography, codicology or any of the fields [David Greetham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Greetham_(textual_scholar)) lays out in _Textual Scholarship_, \"text\" has its specific meanings. As scholars working with computers, we need to be aware of the ways plain text and formatted text differ. Words on a screen may have hidden formatting. Many of us learned to use a word processor like Microsoft Word and don't realize how much is going on behind the words shown on the screen. For the purposes of communicating with the computer and for easier movement between different programs, we need to use text without hidden formatting.\n\n![Word Doc](/images/command-line/worddoc.png)\n\nUsers with visual disabilities, [click here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/raw/v2.0/files/WordProcessorExample.docx) to download the Word file.\n\nIf you ask the command line to read that file, this Word `.docx` file will look something like this\n\n![Word Doc as visualized by Command Line](/images/command-line/CatWordDoc.png)\n\nUsers with visual disabilities, [click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/v2.0/files/PK.md) to download the text file.\n\nWord documents which look like \"just words!\" are actually comprised of an archive of extensible markup language (XML) instructions that only Microsoft Word can read. Plain text files can be opened in a number of different editors and can be read within the command line.\n\n## Plain Text\n\nFor the purposes of communicating with machines and between machines, we need characters to be as flexible as possible. Plain text include characters of readable material but not graphical representation.\n\nAccording to the [Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/),\n\n> Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Unicode-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes.\n\nPlain text shows its cards—if it's marked up, the markup will be human readable. Plain text can be moved between programs more fluidly and can respond to programmatic manipulations. Because it is not tied to a particular font or color or placement, plain text can be styled externally.\n\nA counterpoint to plain text is rich text (sometimes denoted by the Microsoft rich text format `.rtf` file extension) or \"enriched text\" (sometimes seen as an option in email programs). In rich text files, plain text is elaborated with formatting specific to the program in which they are made.\n\nPlain text has two main properties in regard to rich text:\n\n> plain text is the underlying content stream to which formatting can be applied. Plain text is public, standardized, and universally readable.\n\n## Choosing a Text Editor\n\nAn important tool for programming and working in the command line is a text editor. A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files, such as `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.md`. Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as `.docx` or `.rtf`, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain text files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special characters that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from being read correctly.\n\nWhile it doesn't really matter which text editor you choose, you should try to become comfortable with at least one text editor.\n\nChoosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user options, and \"hackability\" vary from program to program.\n\n## Default Recommendation\n\nFor our workshops, we will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Not only is Visual Studio Code free and open source, but it is also consistent across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.\n\nYou will have downloaded Visual Studio Code according to the [instructions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md) on the installations page. We won't be using the editor a lot in this tutorial, so don't worry about getting to know the editor now. In other workshops we will discuss syntax highlighting and version control, which Visual Studio Code supports. For now we will get back to working in the command line itself.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat is the difference between a plain text document and a rich text document? (Select all that apply)\n\n- Plain text contains no formatting, only line breaks and spacing.*\n- Plain text cannot be marked up.\n- Rich text is styled text, _i.e.,_ plain text completed by information such as font size, format, and colors.*\n- One can't determine whether there is a difference betweeen the two without looking at their content.\n\nWhat is the Command Line? How is it different from your text editor?\n\n# Why is the Command Line Useful?\n\nInitially, for some of us, the command line can feel a bit unfamiliar. Why step away from a point-and-click workflow? By using the command line, we move into an environment where we have more minute control over each task we'd like the computer to perform. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you're stepping into the kitchen. It's more work, but there are also more possibilities.\n\nThe command line allows you to...\n\n- Easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files.\n- Set up your programming environment.\n- Run programs you create.\n- Access the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.\n- Control other computers remotely.\n\nIn addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line gives you access to a second set of programs and utilities and is a complement to learning programming.\n\nWhat if all these cool possibilities seem a bit abstract to you right now? That's alright! On a very basic level, most uses of the command line are about **showing information** that the computer has, or **modifying or making** things (files, programs, etc.) on the computer.\n\nIn the next section, we'll make this a little more clear by getting started with the command line.\n\n# Getting to the Command Line\n\n## macOS\n\nIf you're using macOS:\n\n1. Click the Spotlight Search button (the magnifying glass) in the top right of your desktop.\n\n2. Type `terminal` into the bar that appears.\n\n3. Select the first item that appears in the list.\n\n4. When the Terminal pops up, you will likely see either a window with black text over white background or colored text over a black background.\n\n    ![Terminal in macOS](/images/command-line/osx_term.png)\n\nPlease note: You can change the color of your Terminal or BashShell background and text by selecting `Shell` from the top menu bar, then selecting a theme from the menu under `New Window`.\n\nBonus points: if you really want to get the groove of just typing instead of pointing and clicking, you can hold the <kbd>command (⌘)</kbd> key while and press <kbd>space</kbd> to pull up Spotlight search, start typing `Terminal,` and then hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to open a terminal window. This will pull up a terminal window without touching your mousepad. For super bonus points, try to navigate like this for the next fifteen minutes, or even the rest of this session—it is tricky and sometimes a bit tiring when you start, but you can really pick up speed when you practice!\n\n## Windows\n\nWe won't be using Windows's own non-UNIX version of the command line. Instead, we will use Git Bash. If you haven't installed it yet, you can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/git.md). The reason we use Git Bash as the command line on Windows is that it makes you able to run the same commands as you would on a computer running macOS or Linux. Git Bash includes core utilities available on Linux that are not available on Windows.\n\n1. Look for Git Bash in your programs menu and open.\n\n2. If you can't find the git folder, just type `git bash` in the search box and select `git bash` when it appears.\n\n3. Open the program.\n\n4. When the terminal pops up, you will likely see either a window with black text over white background or colored text over a black background.You know you're in the right place when you see the `$`.\n\n  _Note that the sign for you being in the right place might also be a `%` or a `#` depending on your operating system._\n\n![Terminal on Windows](/images/command-line/win_term.png)\n\nBonus points: if you really want to get the groove of just typing instead of pointing and clicking, you can press <kbd>windows</kbd> to open the Start menu, start typing `git bash` and then hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to open a git bash window. This will pull up a command window without touching your mousepad.\n\n## Command Prompt `$`\n\n`$`, which we will refer to as the \"command prompt,\" is the place you type commands you wish the computer to execute. We will now learn some of the most common commands.\n\nWhen you see the `$`, you're in the right place. As noted above, however, the sign varies somewhat between systems, and sometimes the sign is a `%` or a `#`. We call the sign the _command prompt_; it lets us know the computer is ready to receive a command.\n\nIn the following lessons, we will refer to the command prompt using a `$`. Just make a note now of your sign, if it differs from the dollar sign. You will be able to follow along just fine as long as you understand that they all are different ways of knowing that you are \"at the _command prompt_.\"\n\n# Prefatory Pro Tips\n\nBefore we get started, I wanted to give you a couple of tips of things to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, go slow at first and check your spelling! One of the biggest things you can do to make sure your code runs correctly and you can use the command line successfully is to make sure you check your spelling! _Keep this in mind!_ If at first something doesn't work, check your spelling! Unlike in human reading, where letters operate simultaneously as atomistic symbols and as complex contingencies (check [Johanna Drucker](https://genius.com/Johanna-drucker-from-a-to-screen-annotated) on the alphabet), in coding, each character has a discrete function including (especially!) spaces.\n\nSecond, keep in mind that the command line and file systems on macOS and Unix are usually pre-configured as cAsE-pReSeRvInG—so capitalizations also matter when typing commands and file and folder names.\n\nThird, while copying and pasting from this handy tutorial may be tempting to avoid spelling errors and other things, we encourage you not to! Typing out each command will help you remember them and how they work.\n\nNow, we are ready to get started.\n\n# Navigation\n\n## Getting started: know thyself\n\nYou may also see your username to the left of the command prompt `$`. Let's try our first command. Type the following and press <kbd>enter</kbd> on your keyboard:\n\n```console\n$ whoami\n```\n\nThe `whoami` command should print out your username. Congrats, you've executed your first command! This is a basic pattern of use in the command line: type a command, press <kbd>enter</kbd> on your keyboard, and receive output.\n\n## Orienting Yourself in the Command Line: Folders\n\nOK, we're going to try another command. But first, let's make sure we understand some things about how your computer's filesystem works.\n\nYour computer's files are organized in what's known as a hierarchical filesystem. That means there's a top level or `root` folder on your system. That folder has other folders in it, and those folders have folders in them, and so on. You can draw these relationships in a tree:\n\n![An example of how a hierarchical filesystem looks](/images/command-line/hierarchical-filesystem-example.png)\n\nThe root or highest-level folder on macOS is just called `/`. We won't need to go in there, though, since that's mostly just files for the operating system. On Windows, the root directory is usually called `C:`. (If you are curious why `C:` is the default name on Windows, you can read about it [here](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/04/c-drive-default-windows-based-computers-2).)\n\nNote that we are using the word \"directory\" interchangeably with \"folder\"—they both refer to the same thing.\n\nOK, let's try a command that tells us where we are in the filesystem:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n```\n\nYou should get output like `/Users/your-username`. That means you're in the `your-username` directory in the `Users` folder inside the `/` or root directory. This directory is often called the \"home\" directory.\n\nOn Windows, your output would instead be `C:/Users/your-username`. The folder you're in is called the working directory, and `pwd` stands for \"print working directory.\" \"Print\" as a word can be somewhat misleading. The command `pwd` won't actually print anything except on your screen. This command is easier to grasp when we interpret \"print\" as \"display.\"\n\nNow we know \"where\" we are. But what if we want to know what files and folders are in the `your-username` directory, a.k.a. the working directory? Try entering:\n\n```console\n$ ls\n```\n\nYou should see a number of folders, probably including `Documents`, `Desktop`, and so on. You may also see some files. These are the contents of the current working directory. `ls` will \"list\" the contents of the directory you are in.\n\nWonder what's in the `Desktop` folder? Let's try navigating to it with the following command:\n\n```console\n$ cd Desktop\n```\n\nThe `cd` command lets us \"change directory.\" (Make sure the \"D\" in \"Desktop\" is capitalized.) If the command was successful, you won't see any output. This is normal—often, the command line will succeed silently.\n\nSo how do we know it worked? That's right, let's use our `pwd` command again. We should get:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/Users/your-username/Desktop\n```\n\nNow try `ls` again to see what's on your desktop. These three commands—`pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`—are the most commonly used in the terminal. Between them, you can orient yourself and move around.\n\nOne more command you might find useful is `cd ..` which will move you one directory up in the filesystem. That's a `cd` with two periods after it:\n\n```console\n$ cd ..\n```\n\n## Challenge\n\nBefore moving on, take a minute to navigate through our computer's file system using the command line. Use the three commands you've just learned—`pwd`, `ls` and `cd`—eight (8) times each. Go poking around your `Photos` folder, or see what's so special about that root `/` directory. When you're done, come back to your \"home\" folder with\n\n```console\n$ cd ~\n```\n\n(That's a tilde <kbd>~</kbd>, on the top left of your keyboard.) \n\n### Compare with the GUI\n\nIt's important to note that this is the same old information you can get by pointing and clicking displayed to you in a different way.\n\nGo ahead and use pointing and clicking to navigate to your working directory—you can get there a few ways, but try starting from \"My Computer\" and clicking down from there. You'll notice that the folder names should match the ones that the command line spits out for you, since it's the same information! We're just using a different mode of navigation around your computer to see it.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Type `pwd` to see where on your computer you are located.\n2. Type `cd name-of-your-folder` to enter a subfolder.\n3. Type `ls` to see the content of that folder.\n4. Type `cd ..` to leave that folder.\n5. Type `pwd` to make sure you are back to the folder where you wish to be.\n6. Type `cd ~` to go back to your home folder.\n7. Type `pwd` to make sure you are in the folder where you wish to be.\n8. Type `cd /` to go back to your root folder.\n9. Type `ls` to see the content of folder you are currently in.\n10. Type `pwd` to make sure you are in the folder where you wish to be.\n11. Type `cd name-of-your-folder` to enter a subfolder.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat command do you run if you are trying to identify where in the filesystem you are currently located/working?\n- $ `ls`\n- $ `pwd`*\n- $ `cd`\n- $ `whoami`\n\nWhen and why would you want to use the command line as opposed to your operating system's GUI?\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Filesystem](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/filesystem.md)\n- [GUI](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/gui.md)\n- [Root](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/root.md)\n\n# Creating Files and Folders\n\n## Creating a File\n\nSo far, we've only performed commands that give us information. Let's use a command that creates something on the computer.\n\nFirst, make sure you're in your home directory:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/Users/your-username\n```\n\nLet's move to the `Desktop` folder, or \"change directory\" with `cd`:\n\n```console\n$ cd Desktop\n```\n\nOnce you've made sure you're in the `Desktop` folder with `pwd`, let's try a new command:\n\n```console\n$ touch foo.txt\n```\n\nThe `touch` command is used to create a file without any content. This command can be used when you don’t have any data yet to store in it.\n\nIf the command succeeds, you won't see any output. Now move the terminal window and look at your \"real\" desktop, the graphical one. See any differences? If the command was successful and you were in the right place, you should see an empty text file called `foo.txt` on the desktop. Pretty cool, right?\n\n## Handy Tip: Up Arrow\n\nLet's say you liked that `foo.txt` file so much you'd like another! In the terminal window, press the <kbd>up arrow</kbd> on your keyboard. You'll notice this populates the line with the command that you just wrote. You can hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to create another `foo.txt,` (note - [`touch`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_(Unix)) command will not overwrite your document nor will it add another document to the same directory, but it will update info about that file.) or you could use your left/right arrows to move the insert cursor around on the screen so you can, for instance, change the file name to `foot.txt` to create a different file.\n\nAs we start to write more complicated and longer commands in our terminal, the <kbd>up arrow</kbd> is a great shortcut so you don't have to spend lots of time typing.\n\n## Creating Folders\n\nOK, so we're going to be doing a lot of work during the Digital Humanities Research Institute. Let's create a `projects` folder on our desktop, where we can keep all our work in one place.\n\nFirst, let's check to make sure we're still in the `Desktop` folder with `pwd`:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/Users/your-username/Desktop\n```\n\nOnce you've double-checked you're in `Desktop`, we'll use the `mkdir` or \"make directory\" command to make a folder called `projects`:\n\n```console\n$ mkdir projects\n```\n\nNow run `ls` to see if a projects folder has appeared. Once you confirm that the projects folder was created successfully, `cd` into it.\n\n```console\n$ cd projects\n$ pwd\n/Users/your-username/Desktop/projects\n```\n\nOK, now you've got a projects folder that you can use throughout the Institute. It should be visible on your graphical desktop, just like the `foo.txt` file we created earlier.\n\n## Challenge\n\nTry and create a sub-folder and file on your own!\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Type `pwd` to see where on your computer you are located. If you are not in the `projects` folder we just created, navigate to that folder using the commands you learned in the [lesson on navigation](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=6).\n2. Type `mkdir name-of-your-subfolder` to create a subfolder.\n3. Type `cd name-of-your-folder` to navigate to that folder.\n4. Type `challenge.txt` to create a new text file.\n5. Type `ls` to check whether you created the file correctly.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat does the <kbd>up arrow</kbd> command do?\n- It quits the Terminal/GitBash.\n- It undoes my last command.\n- It inserts my last command.*\n- It shows me what folder I am working in.\n\n# Creating a Cheat Sheet\n\nIn this section, we'll create a text file that we can use as a cheat sheet. You can use it to keep track of all the awesome commands you're learning.\n\n## `Echo`\n\nInstead of creating an empty file like we did with `touch`, let's try creating a file with some text in it. But first, let's learn a new command: `echo`.\n\n```console\n$ echo \"Hello from the command line\"\nHello from the command line\n```\n\n## Redirect (`>`)\n\nBy default, the echo command just prints out the text we give it. Let's use it to create a file with some text in it:\n\n```console\n$ echo \"This is my cheat sheet\" > cheat-sheet.txt\n```\n\nNow let's check the contents of the directory:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/Users/your-username/projects\n$ ls\ncheat-sheet.txt\n```\n\nOK, so the file has been created. But what was the `>` in the command we used? On the command line, a `>` is known as a \"redirect.\" It takes the output of a command and puts it in a file. Be careful, since it's possible to overwrite files with the `>` command.\n\nIf you want to add text to a file but _not_ overwrite it, you can use the `>>` command, known as the redirect and append command, instead. If there's already a file with text in it, this command can add text to the file _without_ destroying and recreating it.\n\n## `Cat`\n\nLet's check if there's any text in `cheat-sheet.txt`.\n\n```console\n$ cat cheat-sheet.txt\nThis is my cheat sheet\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `cat` command prints the contents of a file to the screen. `cat` stands for \"concatenate,\" because it can link strings of characters or files together from end to end.\n\n## A Note on File Naming\n\nYour cheat sheet is titled `cheat-sheet.txt` instead of `cheat sheet.txt` for a reason. Can you guess why?\n\nTry to make a file titled `cheat sheet.txt` and observe what happens.\n\nNow imagine you're attempting to open a very important data file using the command line that is titled `cheat sheet.txt`\n\nFor your digital best practices, we recommend making sure that file names contain no spaces—you can use creative capitalization, dashes, or underscores instead. Just keep in mind that the macOS and Unix file systems are usually pre-configured as cAsE-pReSeRvInG, which means that capitalization matters when you type commands to navigate between or do things to directories and files. You may also want to avoid using periods in your file names, as they sometimes can prompt you to confuse them with system files or file extensions (e.g., the full name of a PDF file is usually `file.pdf`).\n\n## Using a Text Editor\n\nThe challenge for this section will be using a text editor, specifically Visual Studio Code ([install guide here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md)), to add some of the commands that we've learned to the newly created cheat sheet. Text editors are programs that allow you to edit plain text files, such as `.txt`, `.py` (Python scripts), and `.csv` (comma-separated values, also known as spreadsheet files). Remember not to use programs such as Microsoft Word to edit text files, since they add invisible characters that can cause problems.\n\n## Challenge\n\nYou _could_ use the GUI to open your Visual Studio Code text editor—from your programs menu, via Finder or Applications or Launchpad in macOS, or via the Windows button in Windows—and then click `File` and then `Open` from the drop-down menu and navigate to your Desktop folder and click to open the `cheat-sheet.txt` file.\n\n_Or_, you can open that specific `cheat-sheet.txt` file in the Visual Studio Code text editor directly from the command line! Let's try that by using the `code` command followed by the name of your file in the command line. (Please note the command `code` prompts your computer to open Visual Code only if you have correctly completed [the software configuration](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md) during installation.)\n\nOnce you've got your cheat sheet open in the Visual Studio Code text editor, type to add the commands we've learned so far to the file. Include descriptions about what each command does. Remember, this cheat sheet is for you. Write descriptions that make sense to you or take notes about questions.\n\nSave the file.\n\nOnce you're done, check the contents of the file on the command line with the `cat` command followed by the name of your file.\n\n## Solution\n\n- Step 1\n    ```console\n    $ code cheat-sheet.txt\n    ```\n\n- Step 2\n    ```console\n    $ cat cheat-sheet.txt\n    My Institute Cheat Sheet\n\n    ls\n    lists files and folders in a directory\n\n    cd ~\n    change directory to home folder\n\n    ...\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat does effect does the following command produce?\n```console\n$ echo \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\" > introduction.txt\n```\n- It adds the line \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\" to the existing content of the `introduction.txt` file.\n- It checks whether the content of the `introduction.txt` file contains the line \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\"\n- It replaces the content of the `introduction.txt` file with the line \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\"*\n- None of the above.\n\n# Pipes\n\nSo far, you've learned a number of commands and one special symbol, the `>` or redirect. Now we're going to learn another, the `|` or \"pipe.\"\n\nPipes let you take the output of one command and use it as the input for another.\n\n![Pipes diagram](/images/command-line/pipes.png)\n\nLet's start with a simple example:\n\n```console\n$ echo \"Hello from the command line\" | wc -w\n5\n```\n![Pipes diagram](/images/command-line/example_pipes.png)\n\nIn this example, we take the output of the `echo` command (\"Hello from the command line\") and pipe it to the `wc` or word count command, adding a flag `-w` for number of words. The result is the number of words in the text that we entered. Flags marked with hyphens, such as `-l` or `-m`, indicate options which belong to specific commands.\n\nLet's try another. What if we wanted to put the commands in our cheat sheet in alphabetical order?\n\nUse `pwd` and `cd` to make sure you're in the folder with your cheat sheet. Then try:\n\n```console\n$ cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort\n```\n\nYou should see the contents of the cheat sheet file with each line rearranged in alphabetical order. If you wanted to save this output, you could use a `>` to print the output to a file, like this:\n\n```console\n$ cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort > new-cheat-sheet.txt\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat do pipes allow you to do?\n\n- Pipes let you take the output of one command and use it as the input for another.*\n- Pipes allow you to combine multiple commands in a single line.*\n- Pipes let you work on multiple files at the same time.\n\n# Exploring Text Data\n\nSo far the only text file we've been working with is our cheat sheet. Now, this is where the command line can be a very powerful tool: let's try working with a large text file, one that would be too large to work with by hand.\n\nLet's download the data we're going to work with:\n\n[Download `nypl_items.csv`](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/raw/v2.0/files/nypl_items.csv)\n\nIf you are using Chrome or Firefox, right click on the link above and select \"Save Link As...\"; make sure you name the file `nypl_items.csv`\nPlease note that, occasionally, [Chrome \"forgets\" to add the extension to your downloaded file](/images/command-line/savelinkaschrome.png); therefore, if your filename doesn't end with `.csv`, [feel free to add it manually](/images/command-line/savelinkaschrome2.png).\n\nOur data set is a list of public domain items from the New York Public Library. It's in `.csv` format, which is a plain text spreadsheet format. CSV stands for \"comma separated values,\" and each field in the spreadsheet is separated with a comma. It's all still plain text, though, so we can manipulate the data using the command line.\n\n## Move Command\n\nOnce the file is downloaded, move it from your `Downloads` folder to the `projects` folder on your desktop—either through the command line, or drag and drop in the GUI. Since this is indeed a command line workshop, you should try the former!\n\nTo move this file using the command line, you first need to navigate to your `Downloads` folder where that file is saved. Then type the `mv` command followed by the name of the file you want to move and then the file path to your `projects` folder on your desktop, which is where you want to move that file to (note that `~` refers to your home folder):\n\n```console\n$ mv nypl_items.csv ~/Desktop/projects/\n```\n\nYou can then navigate to that `projects` folder and use the `ls` command to check that the file is now there.\n\n## Viewing Data in the Command Line\n\nTry using `cat` to look at the data. You'll find it all goes by too fast to get any sense of it. (You can click <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> on your keyboard to cancel the output if it's taking too long.)\n\nInstead, let's use another tool, the `less` command, to get the data one page at a time:\n\n```console\n$ less nypl_items.csv\n...\n```\n\n`less` gives you a paginated view of the data; it will show you contents of a file or the output from a command or string of commands, page by page.\n\nTo view the file contents page by page, you may use the following keyboard shortcuts (that should work on Windows using Git Bash or on macOS terminal):\n\nClick the <kbd>f</kbd> key to view forward one page, or the <kbd>b</kbd> key to view back one page.\n\nOnce you're done, click the <kbd>q</kbd> key to return to the command line.\n\nLet's try two more commands for viewing the contents of a file:\n\n```console\n$ head nypl_items.csv\n...\n\n$ tail nypl_items.csv\n...\n```\n\nThese commands print out the very first (the \"head\") and very last (the \"tail\") sections of the file, respectively.\n\n## Cleaning the Data\n\nWe didn't tell you this before, but there are duplicate lines in our data! Two, to be exact. Before we try removing them, let's see how many entries are in our `.csv` file:\n\n```console\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | wc -l\n100001\n```\n\nThis tells us there are 100,001 lines in our file. The `wc` tool stands for \"word count,\" but it can also count characters and lines in a file. We tell `wc` to count lines by using the `-l` flag. If we wanted to count characters, we could use `wc -m`.\n\nTo find and remove duplicate lines, we can use the `uniq` command. Let's try it out:\n\n```console\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | uniq | wc -l\n99999\n```\n\nOK, the count went down by two because the `uniq` command removed the duplicate lines. But which lines were duplicated?\n\n```console\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | uniq -d\n...\n```\n\nThe `uniq` command with the `-d` flag prints out the lines that have duplicates.\n\n## Challenge\n\nUse the commands you've learned so far to create a new version of the `nypl_items.csv` file with the duplicated lines removed. (Hint: _redirects_ from the lesson when we made a [cheat sheet](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=8) are your friend.)\n\n## Solution\n\nType `pwd` to see where on your computer you are located. If you are not in the `projects` folder we just created, navigate to that folder using the commands you learned in the [lesson on navigation](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=6).\n\nType `ls` to check whether the file `nypl_items.csv` is in your projects folder.\n\nType `cat nypl_items.csv | uniq > new_nypl_items.csv` to create a new version of the `nypl_items.csv` file with the duplicated lines removed.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat do command line flags allow you to do?\n\n- Flags allow you to earmark the file you are working on.\n- Flags are useful to create a new version of the file you are working on, while preserving the old version for future access.\n- Flags are a common way to specify options for command line programs.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Path](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/path.md)\n\n# Interlude\n\n## A Favorite Command Line Feature: Tab Completion\n\nWhen you are navigating in the command line, typing folder and file names can seem to go against the promise of easier communication with your computer. Here comes _tab completion_, stage right!\n\nWhen you need to type out a file or folder name—for example, the name of that csv file we've been working with: `nypl_items.csv`—in the command line and want to move more quickly, you can just type out the beginning characters of that file name up until it's distinct in that folder and then click the <kbd>tab</kbd> key. And voilà! Clicking that <kbd>tab</kbd> key will complete the rest of that name for you, and it only works if that file or folder already exists within your working directory.\n\nIn other words, anytime in the command line you can type as much of the file or folder name that is unique within that directory, and <kbd>tab</kbd> complete the rest!\n\n## Clearing Text\n\nIf all the text remaining in your terminal window is starting to overwhelm you, you have some options. You may type the `clear` command into the command line, or click the <kbd>command (⌘)</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> keys to clear the scrollback. Pressing the <kbd>command (⌘)</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> keys in macOS, or <kbd>control</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> in Windows will clear the output from your most recent command.\n\n# Searching Text Data\n\nSo we've cleaned our data set, but how do we find entries that use a particular term?\n\nLet's say I want to find all the entries in our data set that use the term \"Paris.\"\n\nHere we can use the `grep` command. `grep` stands for \"global regular expression print.\" The `grep` command processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern. Regular expressions are special strings representing a pattern to be matched in a search operation. `grep` gives us access to the power of regular expressions as we search for text.\n\n```console\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | grep -i \"paris\"\n...\n```\n\nThis will print out all the lines that contain the word \"Paris.\" (The `-i` flag makes the command ignore capitalization.) Let's use our `wc -l` command to see how many lines that is:\n\n```console\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | grep -i \"paris\" | wc -l\n191\n```\n\nHere we have asked `cat` to read `nypl_items.csv`, take the output and pipe it into the `grep -i` command, which will ignore capitalization and find all instances of the word `paris`. We then take the output of that `grep` command and pipe it into the word count `wc` command with the `-l` lines option. The pipeline returns `191` letting us know that \"Paris\" (or \"paris\") occurs on 191 lines of our data set.\n\n## Challenge\n\nUse the `grep` command to explore our `.csv` file a bit. What areas are best covered by the data set?\n\n## Solution\nIf you want to get a little more milage out of the `grep` command, refer to [this tutorial on grep and regular expressions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-grep-regular-expressions-to-search-for-text-patterns-in-linux). Regular expressions (or regex) provide methods to search for text in more advanced ways, including specific wildcards, matching ranges of characters such as letters and numbers, and detecting features such as the beginning and end of lines. If you want to experiment with regular expressions in an easy-to-use environment, numerous regex test interfaces are available from [a simple google search](https://www.google.com/search?w&q=regex+tester), such as [RegExr](https://regexr.com/), which includes a handy cheat sheet.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nLet's think about the `grep` command.\n\n- It searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words.*\n- It can be combined with other commands, so as to produce a search that matches their output.*\n- It produces a new file with the lines containing the strings or words you are searching.\n- It delete the strings or words you are searching from a file.\n\n# What We Have Learned\n\nNow is a good time to do a quick review!\n\nIn this session, we learned:\n\n- how to use `touch` and `echo` to create files\n- how to use `mkdir` to create folders\n- how to navigate our file structure by `cd`(change directory), `pwd` (print working directory), and `ls` (list)\n- how to use redirects (`>`) and pipes (`|`) to create a pipeline\n- how to explore a comma separated values (`.csv`) dataset using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`\n- how to search text files using the `grep` command\n\nAnd we made a [cheat sheet](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=8) for reference!\n\nWhen we started, we reviewed what text is—whether plain or enriched. We learned that text editors that don't fix formatting of font, color, and size, do allow for more flexible manipulation and multi-program use. If text is allowed to be a string of characters (and not specific characters chosen for their compliance with a designer's intention), that text can be fed through programs and altered with automated regularity. Text editors are different software than Bash (or Terminal), which is a text-based shell that allows you to interact directly with your operating system giving direct input and receiving output.\n","title":"Command Line Workshop","excerpt":"If asked to show someone who has never seen a computer how to do something on your computer, many of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons.

We will also be discussing the ethical issues that arise in data collection, cleaning, and representation. Because everyone has a different approach and understanding to data and ethics, this workshop will also include multiple sites for discussions to help us think through what data literacies mean within our projects and broader applications.\n\n## What Constitutes Research Data?\n\nThese quotes below offers a variety of perspectives to understanding research data across different stakeholders. The inclusion of these different approaches to research data is to suggest that there is no singular, definitive approach, and is dependent on multiple factors, including your project considerations.\n\n\n> Material or information on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or another research output is based.\n> \n> — <cite>[Queensland University of Technology.

What can you/do you count as data? Here's a small list of possibilities:\n\n- Non-digital text (lab books, field notebooks)\n- Digital texts or digital copies of text\n- Statistical analysis (SPSS, SAS, R)\n- Scientific sample collections\n- Data visualizations\n- Computer code\n- Standard operating procedures and protocols\n- Protein or genetic sequences\n- Artistic products\n- Curriculum materials (e.g. course syllabi)\n- Spreadsheets (e.g. `.xlsx`, `.numbers`, `.csv`)\n- Audio (e.g. `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`)\n- Video (e.g. `.mov`, `.mp4`)\n- Computer Aided Design/CAD (`.cad`)\n- Databases (e.g. `.sql`)\n- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data (e.g. `.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`)\n- Digital copies of images (e.g. `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`)\n- Web files (e.g. `.html`, `.asp`, `.php`)\n- Matlab files & 3D Models (e.g. `.stl`, `.dae`, `.3ds`)\n- Metadata & Paradata (e.g. `.xml`, `.json`)\n- Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during research\n\n\nAdapted from: [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/)\n\n## Evaluation\n\nResearch data can be defined as:\n\n- materials or information necessary to come to my conclusion.*\n- the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings.*\n- method of collection and analysis.\n- objective and error-free.\n\n## Challenge: Forms of Data\n\nThese are some (most!) of the shapes your research data might transform into.\n\n1. What are some forms of data you use in your work?\n2. What about forms of data that you produce as your output? Perhaps there are some forms that are typical of your field.\n3. Where do you usually get your data from?\n\n## Solution:\n\n1. As I am currently exploring discourses on various social media ecosystem, I tend to extract/scrape data that comes through as JSON files, which is a text-file type that is often used to structure large data sets. Sometimes they also come in other forms of data bases such as CSVs or XLS.\n2. Often times outputs are statistical analysis and various data visualizations. This is also pretty comment in my field of psychology.\n3. I can get them from large databases like pushshift.io or scrape certain social media outlets directly such as Twitter.\n\n\n# Stages of Data\n\nWe begin without data. Then it is observed, or made, or imagined, or generated. After that, it goes through further transformations. Stages of data typically consist of a) collection of \"raw\" data, b) processing and/or transforming data, c) cleaning, d) analysis, and e) visualization. For example, we can consider the stages in the following way:\n\n- We start with formulating a research question(s) or hypotheses and set up a project to answer our question(s).\n    - E.g. What proportion of the artwork collected and/or hosted in the Met are by non cis-gender men artists and also in public domain?\n- In the process of setting up the project, we make decisions on what kind of data we think can help us to answer the question\n    - E.g. I think I can get the data from the Met's [open access data set](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/metmuseum/openaccess/master/MetObjects.csv). I will need to look at what variables exist in the dataset to find out if I can filter by gender and the variables that will correspond to copyrights.\n- After collecting our data we then consider and make decisions in the processes of cleaning.\n    - E.g. I have to transform some of the gender values and decide what to do with the missing fields.\n- We then run our preliminary analysis of the data.\n    - E.g. I can run an analysis of the subset of non cis-gender men and public domain media objects against the total number of media objects to find out the proportion.\n- At the end of our analysis, a decision is then made about how would we would present the data and its analysis.\n    - E.g. I can present the result in a pie chart.\n\nThis is one cycle in which data goes from collection to transformation to visualization. This is also *not* the only way to go through the stages. For example, we could do a preliminary analysis first, such as running a correlation of variables, to explore what is missing before we begin the process of cleaning. Often, we also end up doing multiple iterations of cleaning and analysis, making decisions and choices to collapse particular variables or remove them entirely at each iterations. Making sure that we keep a clear documentation of our process will ensure that we are accountable to the data we have collected/are using and also ensure that our results can be replicated and reproduced if others choose to work on our \"raw\" data.\n\n## Naming Conventions for Directory Structures\n\nBefore beginning your data collection, manipulation, and transformation, a good practice is to determine your file naming conventions. How many times have named something as `XXX_FinalFINALFINAL.pdf` or have difficulty searching for a version of the file that contained all that good idea that was edited out in the `XXX_FinalFINALFINALFINAL.pdf` version? While tools like version controlling with git can be helpful, we can also begin with setting up file naming conventions that can help us succeed! Here's an example from [Stanford](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/case-studies/case-study-file-naming) that demonstrates the problems of badly name files in our projects.\n\nFor example, The Graduate Center's [Data Management](https://libguides.gc.cuny.edu/c.php?g=159618&p=1045090) guide suggest that top level folders (such as your main project folder) should include your project title, a unique identifier and the date (year) of your project (e.g. `dataliteracies_XYZ_2020`). Your sub folders and individual files should follow a similar system, with an identifiable activity or project in the file name (e.g. a sub-folder of the project: `sections_xyz_2020`, a file in the project: `lessons_XYZ_2020.doc`).\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/data.md)\n\n# Stages of Data: Raw\n\n\"Raw\" data is yet to be processed, meaning it has yet to be manipulated by a human or computer. Received or collected data could be in any number of formats, locations, etc.. It could be in any of the forms listed in the previous section.\n\nBut \"raw\" data is a relative term, inasmuch as when one person finishes processing data and presents it as a finished product, another person may take that product and work on it further, and for them that data is \"raw\" data. For example, I may consider the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/) data to be \"raw\" as it will require me to filter out missing entries and collapse variables or fields before I can run my analysis. A researcher who participated in the creation of this survey may not consider the version on the site as \"raw\" because the \"raw\" version is the physical paper copies of the file. As you can see, this consideration of what is \"raw\" is non-definitive and is dependent on the project you are working on and the narrative you want to tell with the results.\n\nIf you are interested in further exploration and discussion of the ethics of \"raw\" data, please consider reading [Drucker's article](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html) which has made useful distinctions between \"data\" (understood as given) and \"capta\" (taken or \"captured\") that also troubles the distinction between \"raw\" and \"processed\" data. \n\n## Data and Labor\n\nAs we think about data collection, we should also consider the labor involved in the process. Many researchers rely on Amazon Mechanical Turk (sometimes also referred to as MTurk) for data collection, [often paying less than minimum wage for the task.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-mechanical-turk/551192/) Often the assumption made of these workers is someone who is retired, bored, and participating in online gig work for fun or to kill time. While this may be true for some, [more than half of those surveyed in a Pew Research study cite that the income from this work is essential or important](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/11/17/labor-platforms-technology-enabled-gig-work/). Those who do view the income from this work as essential or important are also mostly from underserved communities. \n\nIn addition to being mindful of paying a fair wage to the workers on such platforms, this kind of working environment also brings some further considerations to the data that is collected. For instance, to get close to minimum wage, workers cannot afford to spend much time on each task. Thinking through these circumstances, how do you think it impacts the data we collected? \n\nFor a deeper discussion on data and labor, consider Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's chapter [Show Your Work](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0vgzaln4/release/2?readingCollection=0cd867ef) in *[Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/)*.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe stages of data is a single iteration process, i.e. there is a fixed stage progression from data collection to visualization.\n- True\n- False*\n\nWhich of the following statements are true for \"raw\" data:\n- is data that is yet to be processed.*\n- is data that is received and/or collected.*\n- is the same to every researcher/research team.\n- can only be collected from participants.\n\n## Challenge: Raw Data and Labor\n\n1. Do you think \"big data\" is \"raw data\"? Why or why not? Do quantity of data play into our assumptions of \"rawness\"?\n2. How should we approach data that we have \"scraped\"?\n3. How do you collect \"raw\" data? What are some of your practices? What are your field's practices?\n4. If you have not done so, open up `moSmall.csv` from your local computer/laptop. As the original file has about 500,000 entries, we've taken a random sample of 1% of the [original dataset](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess). In this case, would you consider this file to be a \"raw\" dataset?\n\n## Solution:\n\n1. I think big data can be raw data depending on how the data is obtained and the processes I need to take before I can apply an analysis. I think that with large datasets, I always assume \"rawness\" because I won't need all of the variables or there will be decisions that need to be made about missing entries.\n2. I think my approach to scraped data is similar to big data.\n3. Currently I collect through either pushshift.io or scrap permissible social media sites on my own or with my collaborator (who will have appropriate authorship). I know that my field of psychology is guilty of the discussion on mechanical turk and also often rely on undergraduates for experimental data collection who would have to sign up for experiments for credits in class or do the labour of working in the lab for the promises of bettering their resume for grad school applications.\n4. The dataset is \"raw\" to me as I will likely be working on removing certain variables/entries to work towards my question.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/data.md)\n- [\"Raw\" Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/raw-data.md)\n\n# Stages of Data: Processed/Transformed\n\nProcessing data puts it into a state more readily available for analysis and makes the data legible. For instance, it could be rendered as **structured data**. This can also take many forms, e.g., a table. Here are a few you're likely to come across, all representing the same data:\n\n## XML\n\n**XML** or eXstensible Markup Language, uses a nested structure, where the \"tags\" like `<Cat>` contain other tags inside them, like `<firstName>`. This format is good for organizing the layout of a document in a tree-like format, just like HTML, where we want to nest elements like a sentence within a paragraph, for example. XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed and can be used in a variety of presentation scenarios.\n\n```xml\n<Cats>\n    <Cat>\n        <firstName>Smally</firstName>\n        <lastName>McTiny</lastName>\n    </Cat>\n    <Cat>\n        <firstName>Kitty</firstName>\n        <lastName>Kitty</lastName>\n    </Cat>\n    <Cat>\n        <firstName>Foots</firstName>\n        <lastName>Smith</lastName>\n    </Cat>\n    <Cat>\n        <firstName>Tiger</firstName>\n        <lastName>Jaws</lastName>\n    </Cat>\n</Cats>\n```\n\n![Screenshot of XML cats file](/images/data-literacies/cats_XML.png)\nThis file is viewed on an online [XML Viewer](https://www.xmlviewer.org/). If you would like to, you can either copy the code chunk above to try it out on [XML Viewer](https://www.xmlviewer.org) or [download the XML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/v2.0/files/cats.xml) to try it out in other viewers. To save the file onto your local computer, **right click** on `Raw` button (top right-hand corner of the data set) and click `Save Link As...` to save the file onto your local computer.\n\nFor example, after downloading the file, can you try to open this file in your browser? (Psst! Try right clicking on `cats.xml` in your local directory and choosing `Open with Other Application` in the drop down menu to select the browser of your choice.)\n\n## JSON\n\n**JSON** or JavaScript Object Notation, also uses a nesting structure, but with the addition of *key/value* pairs, like the `\"firstName\"` *key* which is tied to the `Smally` *value* (at least for the first cat!). JSON is popular with web applications that save and send data from your browser to web servers, because it uses the main language of web browsers, JavaScript, to work with data.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Cats\": [\n        {\n            \"firstName\": \"Smally\",\n            \"lastName\": \"McTiny\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"firstName\": \"Kitty\",\n            \"lastName\": \"Kitty\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"firstName\": \"Foots\",\n            \"lastName\":\"Smith\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"firstName\": \"Tiger\",\n            \"lastName\":\"Jaws\"\n        }\n    ]\n} \n```\n\n![Screenshot of JSON cats file](/images/data-literacies/data-literacies/cats_JSON.png)\nThis file is viewed on my Firefox browser from my local directory. To view it in your browser, you can drag and drop the local file onto a open tab or window. You can also [download the JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/v2.0/files/cats.json) and try opening it in other viewers (e.g. R Studio, webviewers like Code Beautify's [JSON Viewer](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer)). To save the file onto your local computer, **right click** on `Raw` button (top right-hand corner of the data set) and click `Save Link As...` to save the file onto your local computer.\n\n## CSV\n\n**CSV** or Comma Separated Values uses—you guessed it!—commas to separate values. Each line (First Name, Last Name) is a new \"record\" and each column (separated by a comma) is a new \"field.\" This data format stores tabular data in a clean way that facilitates the transfer between different data architectures. As data types go, it is very rudimentary (even predating computers!) and is easy to type, without needing special characters beyond a comma.\n\n```\nFirst Name,Last Name\nSmally,McTiny\nKitty,Kitty\nFoots,Smith\nTiger,Jaws\n```\n\n![Screenshot of CSV cats file](/images/data-literacies/cats_CSV.png)\n\nThis file is viewed on my VSCode with the extension `Excel Viewer`. To view in VSCode, [install the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GrapeCity.gc-excelviewer) in VSCode, open the .csv, and then right click on the file and click `Open Preview`. You can also [download the CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/v2.0/files/cats.csv) to open it in other viewers (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Notepad).

Open data formats are usually available to anyone free-of-charge and allows for easy reusability. Proprietary formats often hold copyrights, patents, or have other restrictions placed on them, and are dependent on (expensive) licensed softwares. If the licensed software cease to support its proprietary format or it becomes obsolete, you may be stuck with a file format that cannot be easily open or (re)used (e.g. .mac). For accessibility, future-proofing, and preservation, keep your data in open, sustainable formats. A demonstration:\n\n1. Open [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/v2.0/files/cats.csv) in a [text editor](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/insights/blob/v2.0/pages/choosing-a-text-editor.md) (e.g. Visual Studio Code, TextEdit (macOS), NotePad (Windows) ), and then in an app like Excel. This is a CSV, an open, text-only, file format. To save the file onto your local computer, right click on `cats.csv` and click `Save Link As` to download the file to your local computer (it's the same cats.csv from above!)\n2. Now do the same with [this Excel file](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/blob/v2.0/files/cats.xlsx?raw=true). Unlike the previous, this is a proprietary format!\n\nSustainable formats are generally unencrypted, uncompressed, and follow an open standard.\n\n<table>\n    <caption>A small list of open formats (more information of each file format is linked in their entries):</caption>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Types of multimedia</th>\n        <th>Examples</th>\n        <th>Common file extensions</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan=\"3\">Images</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/tif-tiff-file-2622393\">TIFF</a> (Tagged Image File Format) </td>\n        <td>`.tiff`, `.tif`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000\">JPEG2000</a></td>\n        <td>`.jp2`, `.jpf`, `.jpx`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html\">PNG</a> (Portable Network Graphics)</td>\n        <td>`.png`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan=\"3\">Text</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/4429-ascii-formats\">ASCII</a>  (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</td>\n        <td>`.ascii`, `.dat`, `.txt`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF\">PDF</a> (Portable Document Format)</td>\n        <td>`.pdf`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values\">CSV</a> (Comma-Separated Values</td>\n        <td>`.csv`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan=\"2\">Audio</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://xiph.org/flac/index.html\">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec)</td>\n        <td>`.flac`</td>\n    </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://xiph.org/ogg/\">ogg</a></td>\n        <td>`.ogg`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan=\"1\">Video</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/mp4-file-2622024\">MPEG-4</a></td>\n        <td>`.mp4`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan=\"3\">Others</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp\">XML</a> (Extensible Markup Language)</td>\n        <td>`.xml`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.json.org/json-en.html\">JSON</a> (JavaScript Object Notation</td>\n        <td>`.json`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.3dsystems.com/quickparts/learning-center/what-is-stl-file\">STL</a> (STereoLithography file format—used in 3D modeling)</td>\n        <td>`.stl`</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th colspan=\"3\"> For a list of file formats, consider the Library of Congress' list of <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/browse_list.shtml#\"> Sustainability of Digital Formats</a>.</th>\n    <tr>\n</table>\n\n## Evaluation\n\nStructured data can be:\n- a XML list.*\n- a Excel table.*\n- an email chain.\n- a collection of text files.\n\nWe may choose to store our data in open data formats because they:\n- are sustainable.\n- allow for easy reusability.\n- are free-of-charge to use.\n- All of the above.*\n\n## Challenge: Processed/Transformed\n\n1. How do you decide the formats to store your data when you transition from 'raw' to 'processed/transformed' data? What are some of your considerations?\n2. Explore the `moSmall.csv` dataset, what questions might you ask with this dataset? What columns (variables) will you keep?\n3. If you are saving the file `moSmall.csv` in a proprietary spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel (Windows/macOS) or Numbers (macOS), you may be prompted to save the file as `.xlsx` or `.numbers`. What format would you choose to save it in? Why would you choose to do so?\n\n## Solution:\n\n1. I usually go with the conventions of the field as it allows me to share my \"in progress\" work easily with my research lab and collaborators. The file conventions can range from `.csv` to `.json`.\n2. I will keep columns (variables) relevant to my question, such as the `Artist Gender`, `Is Public Domain` and `Rights and Reproduction` columns. I will also keep some of the descriptive columns such as `Object ID` and `Artist Role` to help contextualize the results (e.g. what kind of roles do female artists tend to take on?)\n3. I will choose to keep it in a `.csv` file type as it can be opened up by more programs and if Microsoft stops supporting `.xlsx` file types I may no longer have access to opening the dataset. **or** I will choose to switch to a `.xlsx` format as it is easier to use on a graphical user interface like Microsoft Excel. Any stylistic changes I've made to the file will remain as well, such as alternative highlighting rows for readability or bolding column headings.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [CSV (file format)](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/csv.md)\n- [XML (file format)](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/xml.md)\n- [JSON (file format)](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/json.md)\n- [Open Data Formats](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/open-data-formats.md)\n\n# Side Note on Data Structures: Tidy Data\n\nThere are different guidelines to the processing of data, one of which is the **[Tidy Data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)** format, which follows these rules in structuring data:\n\n1. Each variable is in a column.\n2. Each observation is a row.\n3. Each value is a cell.\n\nLook back at our example of cats to see how they may or may not follow those guidelines. **Important note:** some data formats allow for more than one dimension of data (like the `JSON` structure below). How might that complicate the concept of **Tidy Data**?\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Cats\": [\n            {\n                \"Calico\": [\n                    {\n                        \"firstName\": \"Smally\",\n                        \"lastName\":\"McTiny\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"firstName\": \"Kitty\",\n                        \"lastName\": \"Kitty\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"Tortoiseshell\": [\n                    {\n                        \"firstName\": \"Foots\",\n                        \"lastName\":\"Smith\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"firstName\": \"Tiger\",\n                        \"lastName\":\"Jaws\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n}\n```\n\nWhile tiny data is a really popular method of structuring and organizing data, it is not the only way to do so. Depending on the type of data you have, it is also not always the best way to structure data.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nTiny data format only allows one value per cell.\n- True*\n- False\n\nDo you think you can explain the rules of tidy data structuring?\n\n## Challenge: Tidy Data\n1. Looking at the `moSmall.csv` dataset, there are a couple of columns with nested information that don't follow the rules of tidy data. Can you identify at least two of the columns that demonstrates this?\n2. Would you convert `moSmall.csv` to follow the tidy data format? Can you demonstrate how you would do so?\n\n## Solution\n1. `Artist Role`, `Artist Display Name`, `Artist Display Bio`, `Artist Alpha Sort`, `Artist Nationality`, `Artist Begin Date`, `Artist End Date`, or `Classification`.\n2. I will choose to convert to the tidy data format if I was interested in any of the variables listed above, so that it will be easier to analyse the entries. I will have to unnest the entries by separating the data into different columns. For example, if I am interested in understanding the type of roles that are predominantly held by non-cisgender men, I will unnest the column `Artist Role` as two columns (e.g. `Artist 1 Role`, `Artist 2 Role`) as illustrated in this example:\n\n![Comparison of moSmall after tidy format](/images/data-literacies/moSmall2_tidytogether.png)\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Tidy Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tidy-data.md)\n\n# More Stages of Data: Cleaned\n\nHigh quality data is measured in its **validity**, **accuracy**, **completeness**, **consistency**, and **uniformity**.\n\nProcessed data, even in a table, is going to be full of errors:\n\n1. Empty fields\n2. Multiple formats, such as \"yes\" or \"y\" or \"1\" for a positive response.\n3. Suspect answers, like a date of birth of 00/11/1234\n4. Impossible negative numbers, like an age of \"-37\"\n5. Dubious outliers\n6. Duplicated rows\n7. And many more!\n\nCleaning data is the work of correcting the errors listed above, and moving towards high quality. This work can be done manually or programmatically.\n\n### Validity\n\nMeasurements must be valid, in that they must conform to set constraints:\n\n1. The aforementioned \"yes\" or \"y\" or \"1\" should all be changed to one response.\n2. Certain fields cannot be empty, or the whole observation must be thrown out.\n3. Uniqueness, for instance no two people should have the same social security number.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nMeasurements must be accurate, in that they must represent the correct values. While an observation may be valid, it might at the same time be inaccurate. 123 Fake street is a valid, inaccurate street address.\n\nUnfortunately, accuracy is mostly achieved in the observation process. To be achieved in the cleaning process, an outside trusted source would have to be cross-referenced.\n\n### Completeness\n\nMeasurements must be complete, in that they must represent everything that might be known. This also is nearly impossible to achieve in the cleaning process! For instance in a survey, it would be necessary to re-interview someone whose previous answer to a question was left blank.\n\n### Consistency\n\nMeasurements must be consistent, in that different observations must not contradict each other. For instance, one person cannot be represented as both dead and still alive in different observations.\n\n### Uniformity\n\nMeasurements must be uniform, in that the same unit of measure must be used in all relevant measurements. If one person's height is listed in meters and another in feet, one measurement must be converted.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nMeasurements are *accurate* when\n- observations do not contradict each other.\n- they represent the correct values.*\n- when they are unique responses (e.g. no duplication).\n- when the same unit of measure is used in all relevant measurements.\n\n## Challenge: When Do We Stop Cleaning?\n\n1. How do we know when our data is cleaned enough?\n2. What happens to the data that is removed?\n3. Explore the `moSmall.csv` dataset.\n    - Are all the measurements valid? Try checking the `Object ID` column for duplicates.\n    - How might you check if the `Is Public Domain` accurately represents the copyrights of the media objects?\n    - Is the data collected completed? How might you deal with the NA or empty fields?\n        - What assumptions do you have to make when you clean NA or empty fields?\n    - Is the collected data consistent? Does the column `Is Public Domain` correspond with the data in `Rights and Reproduction`? If it does not, which would you follow? Why?\n    - As the dataset is not one that we personally collected, how do we make sense that only `Female` or `|` is collected as responses in the column (with the exception of NA and empty fields)? What do we have to do to the data to make sure it is uniform? What decisions do we make in this process?\n\n## Solution:\n\n1. I think this is often decided before the cleaning process begins, perhaps after some quick visualization or analysis of the \"raw\" data. I generally remove empty entries from my data sets. Working with social media data, I also usually remove URLs as these influence the topic modelling algorithms (e.g. \"http\" may end up being the most prominent topic of the corpus). This is usually where I stop cleaning. Some might suggest the removal of stop words like \"the\" \"a\" \"an,\" but I have always felt very uncertain about the removal of these words. This is especially because the dictionary of stop words were generated through canon western texts that is not representative of the many variations of English. For example, if I were looking at the tweets of Singaporean youths, the stop word dictionary may not be appropriate.\n2. For me, the data is often destroyed (usually because IRB desires it) or it remains in the original \"raw\" file. The file that I clean will always be a duplicate file to allow for recovery in case I made a poor decision in the process of cleaning.\n3. Exploring the dataset, here are my responses to the questions:\n    - Using `Object ID` indicates that there is no duplicates in the dataset. Every entry is unique.\n    - I will have to compare it to another trusted source like a database from [The Getty Research Institute](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/).\n    - The data collected is not completed. There are missing fields. Depending on where the missing field is, I may choose to code it as `0` for the ease of analysis. For example, the column `Dynasty` only contain 1 meaningful entry within this sample data set, as such, I will not run any analysis that may rely on this column and choose to drop it. The column `Accession Year` only has 1 NA and I will choose to drop that row if this becomes a useful variable for my analysis.\n    - While the `Rights and Reproduction` contains a lot of NA and inappropriate responses (e.g. \"Ceramics\"), for the most part, for the items labeled as `YES` in the column `Is Public Domain` the corresponding column in `Rights and Reproduction` does not record a copyright holder. I am assuming that the NA can stand in for the object being in the public domain.\n    - Taking only `Female` as a valid gender response, everything else will be converted to a `0` for ease of analysis. I am assuming `|` as equivalent to a NA or an empty field rather than an alternative gender. Hence in my analysis, the proportion will only record female artists' objects against the rest of the collected items. I cannot necessarily answer the larger question of all non-cisgender men against the total in this case.\n\n# More Stages of Data: Analyzed\n\nAnalysis can take many forms (just like the rest of this stuff!), but many techniques fall within a couple of categories:\n\n### Descriptive Analysis\n\nTechniques geared towards summarizing a data set, such as:\n\n- Mean\n- Median\n- Mode\n- Average\n- Standard deviation\n\n### Inferential Analysis\n\nTechniques geared towards testing a hypothesis about a population, based on your data set, such as:\n\n- Extrapolation\n- P-Value calculation\n\n### Qualitative Analysis\n\nTechniques geared towards understanding a phenomenon, rather than predicting and testing hypotheses, such as:\n\n- Grounded Theory/[Computational Grounded Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxI6W5IIG74FeEtGbjQ0WF9uM0U/view)\n- Content Analysis\n- Text Analysis\n\nAs we have discussed thus far, data are not neutral or objective. They are guided by and produced through our interests and assumptions, often shaped by our socio-political contexts. Hence, we must also understand that the forms of analyses we take to our data further shapes how we are choosing to tell the story. We are crafting a narrative through each of the stages of data that helps us communicate our projects to a wider audience. This is not to say that our analyses are not \"empirical\" or \"scientific\" but a suggestion to make transparent the theoretical foundations and perspectives that are guiding our interpretations. For a more nuanced perspective, consider [The Numbers Don't Speak for Themselves](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/2) in *[Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/).*\n\n## Evaluation\n\nDescriptive analysis help us summarize a data set.\n- True*\n- False\n\n## Challenge: Analysis\n\n1. As we consider the types of analysis that we choose to apply onto our data set, what are we representing and leaving out?\n2. How do we guide our decisions of interpretation with our choices of analyses?\n3. Are we comfortable with the intended use of our research? Are we comfortable with the unintended use of our research? What are potential misuses of our outputs?\n4. What can happen when we are trying to just go for the next big thing (tool/methods/algorithms) or just ran out of time and/or budget for our project?\n\n## Solution:\n\n1. I may choose to leave out data that are perceived to be outliers, especially if they differ to much from the \"normal\" curve. I end up representing only those who fall within the \"normal\" curve which may not actually be an equitable representation.\n2. The interpretation of the results should align itself with the type of analyses that I ran. In addition, it should be guided in some capacity by previous work in this area to inform my understanding.\n3. Potential misuse that I am always concern with is the weaponziation of marginalized participants' words and thoughts. I think I remain somewhat uncomfortable with the unintended use of my research because I don't think I can ever consider every circumstances that the analysis can be misused or misquoted. When I was working on an oral history project, I have set up some layers of boundaries to prevent too easy of an access to audio files as an attempt at negotiating access and protection of my narrators.\n4. In chasing the next big thing, the original intentions for beginning the project might be lost. For me, making sure that my work is meaningful to my communities is important and the excitement of exploring a new tool can sometimes distract me from this intention. Running out of time and/or budget can also mean that the project may end abruptly, and relationships built could be strained in a haphazard wrap up. This brings me back to making sure that before the project begins to spend a significant amount of time on project planning to reduce the chances of this happening.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Descriptive Analysis](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/descriptive-analysis.md)\n- [Inferential Analysis](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/inferential-analysis.md)\n- [Qualitative Analysis](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/qualitative-analysis.md)\n\n# More Stages of Data: Visualized\n\nVisualizing your data helps you tell a story and construct a narrative that guides your audience in understanding your interpretation of a collected, cleaned, and analyzed dataset. Depending on the type of analysis you ran, different kinds of visualization can be more effective than others. In the table below are some examples of data visualization that can help you convey the message of your data.\n\n## Examples of Data Visualization\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Types of

Creating a visual for your data is an art form and you can sometimes find yourself spending a significant amount of time looking for the best ways to visualize your data.\n\nAn example of effective data visualization can be seen in W.E.B. Du Bois [data portraits at the Paris Exposition in 1900](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=%22lot%2011931%22%20NOT%20medal&st=grid&co=anedub&loclr=blogpic), as part of [the Exhibit of American Negroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exhibit_of_American_Negroes_). Using engaging hand-drawn visualizations, he tells the narrative of what it meant to be Black in post-Emancipation America as he translates sociological research and census data to reach beyond the academy. Head [here](https://hyperallergic.com/476334/how-w-e-b-du-bois-meticulously-visualized-20th-century-black-america/) to read more about Du Bois' project.\n\n## Challenge: Visualizations\n\nAs we transform our results into visuals, we are also trying to tell a narrative about the data we collected. Data visualization can help us to decode information and share quickly and simply.\n\n1. What are we assuming when we choose to visually represent data in particular ways?\n2. As you may have realized, many of the visualization examples work with quantitative data, as such, how do you think we can visualize qualitative data? (e.g. Word Clouds, Heat Map)\n3. How can data visualization mislead us? (for e.g. Nathan Yau discusses [how data visualization can lie](https://flowingdata.com/2017/02/09/how-to-spot-visualization-lies/))\n4. How can data visualization help us tell a story? (for e.g. Data Feminism's [On rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints from Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible Standpoints](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/5evfe9yd/release/3?readingCollection=0cd867ef))\n5. Can you try to plot the `moSmall.csv` dataset based on the `Artist Gender` variable? What would you have to do before you can plot this graph? How might you explain what your visualization represents?\n\n## Solution\n\n1. An underlying assumption we make is that the conventions of top-down, left-right is universal or at least universal enough for most folx to understand. This neglects potential right-to-left readers. Certain conventions that use color as a way to represent good and bad (e.g. green as good and red as bad) also assumes that this is an effective differentiation that excludes those who have visual impairments can decipher the data in a similar fashion.\n2. Exploring [Voyant-Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) can be a good place to start to see how visualization of qualitative data can look like.\n3. Exaggerated differences through the choice of scales on the x and y-axis can misled a casual viewer to think that the data is representing a larger difference than it actually is reporting.\n4. Data visualization can help us convey dense information quickly. The casual viewer can glance at the visualization and understand what we are trying to communicate with our data. Data visualization also can be affective device, like the DuBois' examples which helps to tell the urgency of the narrative/story.\n5. The difficulty of representing this dataset is how at first glance there's an assumption that gender is binary given that only 2 bars are representing the dataset. Even though the other bar is labeled `Unknown` to suggest that this is not a comprehensive breakdown, I'm not sure how effective it is.\n![Plot of media objects in public domain by gender of artist](/images/data-literacies/genderPD.png)\n\n# Data Literacy and Ethics\n\nThroughout the workshop we have been thinking together through some of the potential ethical concerns that might crop up as we proceed with our own projects. Just as we have discussed thus far, we hope that you see that data and ethics is an ongoing process throughout the lifespans of your project(s) and don’t often come with easy answers.\n\n## Final Activity\n\nIn this final activity, we would like for you to think about some of the potential concerns that might come up in the scenario below and think about how you might approach them.\n\nYou are interested in looking at the reactions to the democratic party presidential debates across time. You decided that you would use data from Twitter to analyze the responses. After collecting your data, you learned that your data has information from users who were later banned and included some tweets that were removed/deleted from the site.\n\nAs you work through this activity, you can definitely choose to do so with your partner! And we highly encourage you to do so! Different perspectives can offer us different insights to our own gaps and help us in thinking through our decisions. Be prepared to discuss your thoughts and ideas when we \"meet\" for our sessions.\n\n### If You Would Like Some Guiding Questions\n\n- What are some reasons you might have for anonymizing (or not) your data?\n    - Would your approach differ if the responses were anonymized v. not?\n- Would you remove the data in your initially downloaded corpus?\n    - How might you be aware of the differences in the corpus you downloaded v. the most current information?\n- Would the number of tweets generated impact your decisions?\n- How might where you are at in the stages of data (e.g. \"raw\" data v. \"cleaned\" data v. analysed) affect your choices?\n\n### Some Additional Exploration\n\n- If you were collecting and/or analyzing data on folx in power, such as looking at the data from [Tweets of Congress'](https://alexlitel.github.io/congresstweets/) project, would that change the way you consider your answers to the previous questions?\n- Current [ethical guidelines](https://safelab.socialwork.columbia.edu/content/ethics) from SAFE Lab at Columbia University have decided to alter the text of social media post to render it unsearchable. Why and when would you consider (or not) altering the collected tweets for publication? \n\n# Some Concluding Thoughts\n\nData and ethics are contextually driven. As such, there isn’t always a risk-free approach. We often have to work through ethical dilemmas while thinking through information that we may not have (what are the risks of doing/not doing this work?). We have approached a moment where the question is no longer what we could do but what we should do. Given this saturated data-driven world we currently live in, there is value in pausing and consider why and what we are collecting, researching, analyzing, and understanding. Starting on a new project, especially one dealing with \"big\" data can be exciting but we now also have to first consider who does the data collected benefit and [why is it important are important](https://www.manifestno.com/). The IRB (Institutional Review Board)'s regulations may form the starting point of our considerations but should not be the ending point of how we consider contextually-driven ethics and data projects.\n\nIn addition, open access is not always the answer to concerns of reproducibility and/or ethical considerations. There are moments where the decision to not have a dataset or analysis openly accessible is valid. For example, when you are working with marginalized or vulnerable populations, concerns for causing more harm justifies restricting access. We may choose to control who has access to decrease the chances of misrepresentations (intentional or otherwise) or having results taken out of contexts.\n\nFor a set of great questions to help you think through your data exploration and project planning, please check out Kristen Hackett's Tagging the Tower post, [_What to Consider when Planning a Digital Project_.](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2019/10/30/what-to-consider-when-planning-a-digital-project/)","title":"Data Ethics","excerpt":"What is data?

Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a _repository_. In the context of this workshop, it refers to a folder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. We will explore these features in the current workshop. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create \"branches\" of a project to explore different futures. These are advanced features, which we will provide resources for you to explore later. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually merged with the main project.\n\n**GitHub** is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.\n\n\n## Highlighting Distinctions\n\nAs we move forward it's important to make sure we're firm on the distinctions between the three different tools outlined above.\n\n**Git** is a software that you use on your laptop, or your local computer/machine. The repository with your project's files is stored on your hard drive. You also edit the text files on your local machine using a plain text editor, which is another software on your local computer like Visual Studio Code.\n\n**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that you access through your internet browser. Even though you physically are still in the same place, working on your laptop, you are no longer working on your local machine, you are on the Internet. This is a fundamentally different location than when you're working with your Git repository and editing and creating files in your plain text editor. With GitHub, you are uploading your repository—as described above—from your local machine to this platform on the Internet to be shared more broadly. You can also create private repositories if you want to use GitHub to backup a project.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich of the following best describes _version control_:\n- a software installed on my local machine\n- the practice of tracking and organizing the state of a file over time, as it changes*\n- a language that can be read and rendered by some web-based platforms\n- a cloud-based software\n\nWhich of the following best describe Git:\n- a software installed on my local machine*\n- the practice of tracking and organizing the state of a file over time, as it changes\n- a web-based plaform for storing and sharing files\n- a version control software*\n- a cloud-based software\n- refers to project folders as \"repositories\"*\n\nWhich best describes GitHub:\n- a cloud-based software*\n- a software installed on my local machine\n- a web-based plaform for storing and sharing files*\n- a version control software\n- refers to project folders as \"repositories\"*\n- the practice of tracking and organizing the state of a file over time, as it changes\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Git](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/git.md)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/github.md)\n- [Version Control](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/version-control.md)\n\n\n# What You Can Do with Git and GitHub\n\nA [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:\n\n- Developing software\n- Sharing data sets\n- Creating websites\n- Writing articles and books\n- Collating online resources\n- Keeping research notes\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials\n\n## Why Use GitHub?\n\nParticipants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated:\n\n- Sharing and backing up files on multiple computers\n- Monitoring changes effectively\n- Recovering from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose\n- Using different branches for experiments and new directions\n- Sharing and managing files with others—seeing who added what content and when\n\n## How We Use GitHub\n\n### Sharing and Attribution\n\nAs you can see across these sessions, we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing. It also facilitates attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, when it was added, and which projects or materials are derived from others.\n\n**Case One: This Session**\n\nIf you [go this to workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git) and look at the top of the page just under the workshop title, `DHRI-Curriculum/git`, you can see it is `forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018` (next to the red star). That line shows that this particular repository is copied from (_\"forked from\"_) the curriculum for a session presented at our January 2018 Institute by \"pswee\" (former Graduate Center Digital Fellow Patrick Sweeney). If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. We'll expand on _forking_ in the final section of this workshop.\n\n![Image of what attribution looks like in GitHub](/images/git/attribution.png)\n\n\n### Collaborative Writing\n\nGit is also used in writing projects! _Version control_ makes tracking changes tractable, especially when there are multiple authors working asynchronously. It can be an alternative to using track changes in Microsoft Word, or comments and edits in a Google Doc.\n\n**Case Two: Coauthored Publications**\n\nGit and GitHub—together or independently—support multi-author publishing. Like we have done with the DHRI curriculum, you can have a shared project folder that multiple people are working from asynchronously, even on the same parts if they wanted, and then those different offshoots can be carefully folded back into the main project. A singular author can also create different offshoots on their own, allowing the writer to explore different ways forward. This, combined with version control, allows authors to easily return to and compare older drafts or retrieve sections previously discarded.\n\nWe encourage you to explore these features after you gain a grasp on the fundamentals in the current workshop. You can find resources to do this on the [Theory to Practice](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/v2.0/theory-to-practice.md) page!\n\n### Versions Across Time\n\nHow did you initially come by the syllabus you use for your class(es), and did you develop it over time? Many professors borrow and adapt from each other, and most of us probably update our syllabi each semester, even if only a little bit.\n\nThrough this process, many of us end up with a set of files that looks something like this:\n\n![Example of a messy folder structure with many files named similarly](/images/git/messy-file-structure.png)\n\nWhile I probably can tell which version is the \"final\" one, I can not see what was changed along the way or how the different versions vary from each other.\n\nWith Git, you would save these multiple versions over time as one file, and each version you save includes a note about what has changed so you can easily revert back to an older version if needed.\n\nBy looking at the file list, you also can not tell who the syllabus originally came from, or if there were contributions from many individuals. Git and GitHub can help make attribution clear, and maintain it over time as the syllabus travels between hands.\n\n**Case Three: Syllabi**\n\nIncreasingly we see that faculty are sharing their syllabi on GitHub (example: [DLCL 204: Digital Humanities Across Borders](https://github.com/quinnanya/dlcl204)). Some are even using GitPages that apply a user-friendly interface to their repository to make it easier to access and navigate for their students (example: [Digital History](https://digitalhistory.github.io/)).\n\nGitHub offers a way of making a course publicly avaiable on the web, and sometimes easier or more intuitive to users than some learning management systems. Git helps track the changes over time.\n\nWhen the softwares are used together, Git and GitHub also support a collaborative appraoch to syllabi development. Copying another's project and modifying and remixing the content to meet your needs is a seamless and transparent process. Attribution of specific changes over time is a foundational function of how Git operates; GitHub explicitly renders attribution, making it easy to see who(s) did what. This is one of the attractions of using the platform.\n\nIn a practical sense, you could search other syllabi on GitHub, and share yours so it could be searched by others. If someone finds a syllabus that includes parts they want to use, they could fork that syllabi to their GitHub account, and download the files to your local machine and edit them there. Any changes could then be added back to the repository on GitHub, thereby sharing your amendments publicly. On GitHub, attribution of who contributed what are transparent. Meanwhile, your amended version would be available for others to modify and re-share.\n\nEven if you were only working with your own self-created syllabus, like we'll do later in this workshop, Git and GitHub can be useful for tracking your changes without the hassle of multiple files. From one file, you can use Git to compare your current version with older versions; you can also compare and share these different versions on GitHub if you wanted.\n\nWe will cover these features in-depth in a later lesson in this workshop.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat tasks could Git and/or GitHub offer support to?\n- Developing software*\n- Creating and sharing data sets*\n- Creating websites*\n- Writing articles and books*\n- Collating online resources*\n- Keeping research notes*\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Version Control](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/version-control.md)\n\n# Review of the Command Line\n\nDuring this workshop, you'll be communicating with GitHub from your local computer via the command line (the Terminal or the Git Bash on Windows). This section reviews some of the basic commands that will also be used in this workshop.\n\nIn addition to the command line, you'll be using your text editor and your browser. Before continuing, its important that we clearly distinguish between these three different spaces or environments:\n- Your plain text editor where you'll be writing your syllabus is on your local computer.\n- That syllabus is initiailly saved in a git-enabled repository on your local computer.\n- Your browser is where you'll be uploading your repository to GitHub, a cloud service.\n- Your terminal is where you'll be communicating with GitHub to send the repository and project files back and forth between the cloud (which you can view through the GitHub website) and your hard drive.\n\nBecause you'll be moving between these three spaces throughout the workshop, you may want to use (<kbd>command (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd>) or (<kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd>) to move quickly between the three windows on your desktop.\n\n## Accessing the Terminal\n\n### macOS\n\nHold the <kbd>command (⌘)</kbd> key and press the <kbd>space</kbd> bar at the same time to bring up the \"Spotlight Search\" window. Type `terminal`, followed by <kbd>enter</kbd> to quickly open the Terminal.\n\n### Windows\n\nPress the <kbd>windows</kbd> button on your keyboard. When the search menu pops up, type `git bash` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.\n\n## Practice Navigating the Command Line\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable navigating your hard drive through the command line, here is a short section catching you up. _If you feel fairly comfortable using the command line, you can skip this section, and go straight to the next one._\n\nYou can create the folder anywhere on your hard drive by typing the following into your terminal and hitting <kbd>enter</kbd>.\n\n```console\n$ cd <directory-name>\n```\n\nLet's practice this command by using it to take us to our Desktop. Type the following command into your terminal and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>.\n\n```console\n$ cd Desktop\n```\n\nThis will change your current working directory from `/Users/<your-name>` to `/Users/<your-name>/Desktop`.\n\nCheck your current directory by typing the following command into your terminal and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n```\n\nNow, use the following command to go up one directory:\n\n```console\n$ cd ..\n```\n\nCheck your current directory again using the following command. You should be back in your \"home\" directory:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n```\n\nPractice going back and forth between your Desktop and your home directory.\n\nWhen finished, go to your Desktop folder and check that you're there with `pwd`.\n\n## Making a Projects Folder\n\nIn this session, we will be making a syllabus and using Git to keep track of our revisions. Let's create a Git project folder.\n\nIf you've worked through the command line session, you should already have a `projects` folder on your desktop. _If you don't have a projects folder on your desktop, create one using the following command_:\n\n```console\n$ mkdir projects\n```\n\nFrom `Desktop`, Navigate into your `projects` folder using the following command:\n\n```console\n$ cd projects\n```\n\nThen create a `git-practice` folder with the following command:\n\n```console\n$ mkdir git-practice\n```\n\nNavigate into the new `git-practice` folder using the following command:\n\n```console\n$ cd git-practice\n```\n\nAt this point, when you type `pwd`, your folder structure should look like this:\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/home/<username>/Desktop/projects/git-practice\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich best describes where you are working when you're writing in your plain text editor:\n- on my local machine*\n- on the internet\n\nWhich best describes where you are working when you're using your terminal to communicate with GitHub and share the files:\n- on my local machine*\n- on the internet\n\nWhich best describes where your files are when you are viewing them in GitHub:\n- on my local machine\n- on the internet*\n\nGit-enabled repository means\n- none of the files on my local machine are being tracked\n- a specific file on my local machine is being tracked\n- a specific folder on my local machine is being tracked*\n- all the files on my local machine are being tracked\n\nWhich command do you use to make a new folder?\n- `pwd`\n- `cd`\n- `mkdir`*\n\nWhich command do you use to enter into a folder?\n- `pwd`\n- `cd`*\n- `mkdir`\n\nWhich command do you use to check where you are?\n- `pwd`*\n- `cd`\n- `mkdir`\n\n# Setting Up Git\n\nThrough this section, you'll be checking your installation and configuring Git with your own name and information.\n\n## Check Your Installation\n\nFirst, let's make sure Git has been successfully installed. In your terminal, type the following command:\n\n```console\n$ git --version\n```\n\nIf you see a version number, you're all set. If not, follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/git.md).\n\n## Configuring Git on Your Computer\n\nOur first step in working with Git is letting the software know who we are so it can track our work and attribute our contributions. This information is useful because it connects identifying information with the changes you make in your repository.\n\nType the following _two commands_ into your command line, replacing the \"John Doe\" and \"johndoe@example.com\" with your name and email (use quotations where you see them). These do not necessarily need to be the name and email you used to sign up for GitHub. Remember, these are different spaces and different softwares.\n\n```console\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n```\n\nTo check your set-up, type the following command into your terminal:\n\n```console\n$ git config --list\n```\n\nYou should get something that looks like this except with whatever information you entered previously:\n\n```\nuser.name=Superstar Git User\nuser.email=gitsuperstar@gmail.com\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat are you doing when you set up git?\n- You are creating a new version of the software on your local machine.\n- You are sending files from your local machnine to GitHub?\n- You are introducing yourself to the software, so it knows who you are.*\n- You are creating a new version of a project folder on your local machine.\n\n# Creating a Syllabus File\n\nThe next step is to _initialize_ the project folder that we want Git to track. Even though we configured Git for our computer, Git doesn't start tracking every single file on our computer. That would turn into a headache quickly. We only want Git to track changes for files within specific folders/projects.  \n\nWhen we initialize a folder, we are telling Git to pay attention to it. This only needs to happen once because what is actually happening through this process is Git is adding a hidden subfolder within your folder that houses the internal data structure required for version control. After initialization, Git is ready to track the files within the folder. The folder is now considered a Git _repository_.\n\nFirst, use `cd`, navigate to the `git-practice` folder (inside `projects`). From your home directory, you can do all of them in one command by typing the following into your terminal:\n\n```console\n$ cd Desktop/projects/git-practice\n```\n\nNext we're going to _initialize_ our repository using the `git init` command, which should generate the following output:\n\n```console\n$ git init\nInitialized empty Git repository in /home/<your-username>/projects/git/.git/\n```\n\nNow Git is tracking our directory. However, it has not done any versioning yet. This is because 1) we haven't told Git to take a snapshot yet, and 2) there are no files in the folder to take a snapshot of. For now, Git knows this folder exists and is prepared to take a snapshot of the files when you tell it to.\n\nBefore version control is useful, we'll have to create a text file for Git to track. For this session, the file we will track will be a course syllabus—we'll create that next.\n\n### Creating a Syllabus file\n\nTo create a plain text file, we're going to switch to our text editor, Visual Studio Code, to create and edit a file named `syllabus.md` and save it to our `git-practice` folder. The `.md` extension indicates that it is a Markdown file, which is a special file format we will dive into in the next section.  \n\nIf you have not installed Visual Studio Code, review [the installation instructions here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md).\n\nIn terminal, check to make sure you are in your `git-practice` folder. (_Hint_: use `pwd` to see what directory you are currently in.)\n\nNext, open the `syllabus.md` file in Visual Studio Code using:\n\n```console\n$ code syllabus.md\n```\n\nYou should see a window appear that looks similar to this:\n\n![Image of what Visual Studio Code looks like when opening the syllabus.md file](/images/git/vscode1.png)\n\nIf Visual Studio Code does not open when you use the `code` command in your terminal, open it using the Start Menu on Windows or Spotlight Search on macOS as you would any other software. Then click `File > Open File` and use the dialog to navigate to the `/Users/<your-name>/Desktop/projects/git` folder and create a `syllabus.md` file there.\n\nWe'll be typing our markdown into this file in the Visual Studio Code window. At any time, you can save your file by hitting <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> on macOS. Alternatively, you can click the `File` menu on the top right, then select `Save` from the dropdown menu.\n\nSaving frequently is advised. When we get to the version contol functionality of Git, only changes that are saved will be preserved when a version is created.\n\n# Creating Syllabus Content Using Markdown\n\nWe'll be using **Markdown** to write a syllabus, and then using **Git** to track any changes we make to it. Markdown allows us to format textual features like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a plain text file using a streamlined set of notations that humans can interpret without much training. Markdown files usually have a `.md` extension.  \n\n**Markdown** is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.\n\nWhereas you use HTML and CSS with WordPress, you use Markdown to render legible documents on GitHub. Markdown has fewer options for marking text than HTML. It was designed to be easier to write and edit.  \n\nFor comparison, you learned to create headers in HTML like this:\n\n```html\n<h1>My Syllabus Heading</h1>\n```\n\nIn Markdown, we insert headings with a single hash mark like this:\n\n```markdown\n# My Syllabus Heading\n```\n\nA sub-heading (H2) heading uses two hash marks like this:\n\n```markdown\n## Readings\n```\n\nThe lessons of this workshop were originally written in markdown. You can see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/v2.0/lessons.md) what they look like in their raw, unrendered form.\n\nCompare that with this—the source code for this lesson's web page, written in HTML [here](view-source:http://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/git/lessons/).\n\nMarkdown is also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like `.docx` because of its simplicity and related ability to be read across multiple platforms. Use of Markdown is also supported by document-conversion tools like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) that can change a markdown file to an `.epub` with one command entered into your terminal.\n\nHere are a few more key elements to get you ready to make your own syllabus in Markdown. \n\nTo provide emphasis, place asterisks around some text:\n\n```markdown\n*This text will appear italicized.*\n**This text will appear bold.**\n```\n\nFor emphasis, you need to mark where it should start and where it should end, so you need astrisks at the beginning and end of whatever text is being emphasized.\n\nTo create a bulleted list, put a hyphen at the beginning of each list item:\n\n```markdown\n- Reading one\n- Reading two\n- Reading three\n```\n\nTo create a link, put the anchor text (the text you will see) in square brackets and the URL in parentheses, directly following the anchor text in brackets. Don't put a space between them:\n\n```markdown\nI teach at [The Graduate Center, CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu).\n```\n\nParagraphs of text are denoted by putting a blank line between them:\n\n```markdown\nThis is a paragraph in markdown. It's separated from the paragraph below with a blank line. If you know HTML, it's kind of like the <p> tag. That means that there is a little space before and after the paragraph when it is rendered.\n\nThis is a second paragraph in markdown, which I'll use to tell you what I like about markdown. I like markdown because it looks pretty good, if minimal, whether you're looking at the rendered or unrendered version. It's like tidy HTML.\n```\n\n## Challenge\n\nUse these five elements—headings, emphasis, lists, links, and paragraphs—to create a syllabus. Have a main heading that gives the course title (one `#`), then subheadings for, at least, course info and readings. Use emphasis (`*`) for book titles and try to get a list in there somewhere.\n\nIf you want an a more advanced challenge, you can review some additional markdown elements on [this page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and add some extra features like images, blockquotes, or horizontal rules.\n\n## Example\n\nYou can look at an example syllabus in raw text form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/main/sections/syllabus.md). You can see what it looks like when it's rendered by GitHub [on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/main/sections/syllabus.md). When editing the markdown file in Visual Studio Code, it might look like this:\n\n![What your markdown might look like when typed into Visual Studio Code](/images/git/vscode2.png)\n\n## Tips\n\n1. Visual Studio Code also has a preview feature for your markdown. Hit the preview button on the top right while editing your markdown file:\n\n    ![Button to hit to get a preview in Visual Studio Code](/images/git/vscode3.png)\n\n    You'll get two side-by-side panels. Your markdown file will be on the left, and your rendered preview will be on the right:\n\n    ![Side by side markdown and preview in Visual Studio Code](/images/git/vscode4.png)\n\n2. Remember to save your work—regularly!—with <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> on macOS.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich best describes what you're doing when you initialize your project folder:\n- You created a new version of your project folder\n- You told Git to pay attention to your project folder*\n- You told Git to set up its file structure within your project folder so it can track changes to your files.*\n- You use the command `mkdir` in your terminal\n- You use the command `git init` in your terminal*\n\nWhich best describes Markdown:\n- a software installed on my local machine\n- a language for formatting plain text files*\n- a language that can be read and rendered by some web-based platforms*\n- a version control software\n- a cloud-based software\n- refers to project folders as \"repositories\"\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Markdown](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/markdown.md)\n\n# Staging and Committing Changes\n\nGit's primary function is version control, or to track a project as it exists at particular points in time. Now that we have a file to track—our `syllabus.md`—let's use Git to save the current state of the repository as it exists now.\n\n## A Metaphor for Adding and Committing\n\nIn Git, a _commit_ is a snapshot of a repository that is entered into its permanent history. To commit a change to a repository, we take two steps:\n\n1. Adding files to a \"staging area,\" meaning that we intend to commit them.\n2. Finalizing the commit.\n\nStaging a file or files is you telling Git, \"Hey! Pay attention these files and the changes in them\". \n\nMaking a commit is a lot like taking a photo. First, you have to decide who will be in the photo and arrange your friends or family in front of the camera (the staging process). Once everyone is present and ready, you take the picture, entering that moment into the permanent record (the commit process).\n\nWhy do you need both steps? Sometimes when you're working on a project you don't want to pay attention to all the files you changed. Perhaps you fixed a bug in some code, but also did some work on your manuscript document. You may want to only commit the changes you made to the code because you still haven't finished your thoughts on the manuscript. You can stage, or `add`, the code file so Git knows to only commit the changes made to that file. Later, you can stage and then commit the manuscript changes on their own once you've finished your thought. \n\n## Staging Changes with the `add` Command\n\nFirst, let's see what state Git is currently in. We do that with the `git status` command. It's a good idea to use this command before and after doing anything in a Git repository so you can always be on the same page as the computer.\n\nMake sure you're in your `/home/<your-name>/Desktop/projects/git-practice` directory using the `pwd` command in the terminal. Once you're there, enter `git status` and you should see the following output:\n\n```console\n$ git status\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n\tsyllabus.md\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n```\n\n\"Nothing added to commit\" means that we have initialized our repository, but haven't made any commits yet. _If you're instead getting a message that begins with the word `fatal` when you use `git status`, you may be in the wrong directory or perhaps you haven't run the `git init` command on your directory yet._\n\nLet's follow the recommendation in the status message above and use the `add` command to stage files, making them ready to be committed.\n\nWe will go ahead and add `syllabus.md` by writing the following in the terminal:\n\n```console\n$ git add syllabus.md\n```\n\nYou should see no output from the command line, which should be interpreted as a the above command succeeded. It is what we call \"succeeding silently.\" Let's run `git status` again to have a \"sanity check\"—to make sure that things have changed. You should see output like this:\n\n```\n$ git status\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)\n\n\tnew file:   syllabus.md\n```\n\nThe `new file:   syllabus.md` should be highlighted in green to show that it's ready for commit.\n\nThis is Git telling you, \"Ok, I see the file(s) you're talking about.\"\n\n## Committing Changes\n\nNow that our files have been staged, let's commit them, making them part of the permanent record of the repository. In the terminal, type:\n\n```console\n$ git commit -m \"Initial commit of syllabus file\"\n```\n\nThe `-m` flag provides that the message following the flag (in quotation marks) along with the commit. The message will tell others—or remind a future version of yourself—what the commit was all about. Try not to type `git commit` without the `-m` flag—there's a note about this below.\n\nAfter running the command, you should see output like this:\n\n```\n[main (root-commit) 8bb8306] Initial commit of syllabus file\n  1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n  create mode 100644 syllabus.md\n```\n\nThis means you have successfully made your first commit in the repository—congratulations! There are a few things going on in this message. The relevant information for you for now is the second line, which tells you that one file was changed, and there were no insertions or deletions. You have a fresh new file! \n\nLet's check the state of our repository after the commit by running `git status`:\n\n```\n$ git status\nOn branch main\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n```\n\nThis means that everything in the repository is successfully committed and up-to-date. If you edit your syllabus file or create a new file in the repository, the message you get with `git status` will instead list files that have uncommitted changes.\n\nLet's run one other command to see the effect our commit has had. Enter this command:\n\n```console\n$ git log\n```\n\nYou should see output similar to this:\n\n```\ncommit 8bb8306c1392eed52d4407eb16867a49b49a46ac (HEAD -> main)\nAuthor: Your Name <your-email-here@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sun May 20 16:03:39 2018 -0400\n\n    Initial commit of syllabus file\n```\n\nThis is the log of commits, comprising a history of your repository. There's only one commit here now, though. If you don't see a prompt (the `$`) after running `git log`, you may need to press the <kbd>q</kbd> key (just the <kbd>q</kbd> key by itself) to return to the command line.\n\n## Why Do We Need to Use the `-m` Flag?\n\nThe `-m` flag is useful for human purposes and technical purposes. For human purposes, the `-m` flag helps you keep track of the changes you're making. Version control is most useful when you can confidently return to a specific version. It can also help you be more structured in your approach to making changes—your notes to self are limited, so to make them clear, you might make commits after specific tasks are completed. If you update readings for the first week of classes or if you add another reading, you will want to make a commit. This can also make it easier to reverse a specific change in the future.\n\nAlso, if you type `git commit` by itself, git will open the command line's default text editor to allow you to enter the commit message in a file-like environment. It looks something like this:\n\n![Example of what the vi screen looks like](/images/git/vi.png)\n\nThis unfamiliar screen is the default text editor, `vi`, and it requires some knowledge to use. We don't teach it as part of our sessions, but if you find yourself stuck in this screen, you can try this trick to leave that environment and return to your usual command prompt. Type `:q` and then press <kbd>enter</kbd>. You should be back to the command line with a message saying:\n\n```console\nAborting commit due to empty commit message.\n```\n\nIf you make a mistake where you include an opening quotation mark but forget a closing one, you might accidentally end up inside a \"quote prompt.\" You will know you're there when your command prompt changes to `quote>`. If this happens, you can just keep writing as much of your commit message as you want, and then end it with the same quotation mark that you opened the commit message with.\n\nAnother option is to press <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> on your keyboard, which will exit the quote prompt and cancel any commits you were trying to perform.\n\n## Pro-tip for the Command Line: How to exit unknown screens\n\nIf you're ever stuck or \"trapped\" on the command line, try running through these common exit commands to return to the prompt:\n\n- <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>\n- <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>\n- `q` followed by <kbd>enter</kbd>\n- `:q` followed by <kbd>enter</kbd>\n\n<kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> attempts to abort the current task and restore user control. <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> escapes the current shell environment—if you use it at the normal `$` prompt, it will end the current command line session. `q` is often used as a command (followed by <kbd>enter</kbd>) to escape from specific programs like `less`. `:q` is the command used in `vi` that changes the mode of interaction (`:`), allowing you to enter the `q`, a one-letter command to quit, which must be followed by <kbd>enter</kbd>. Thus, it's a command specific to `vi`.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich best describe the process of _staging_:\n- you telling Git to take a snapshot of changes made to a file.\n- you telling Git which files with changes you want it to pay attention to.*\n- you telling git to pay attention to a folder storing files you want to make changes to.\n- the second part of a two-step process.\n\nWhich best describes the process of _committing_:\n- you telling Git to take a snapshot of changes made to a file.*\n- you telling Git which files with changes you want it to pay attention to.\n- you telling git to pay attention to a folder storing files you want to make changes to.\n- the second part of a two-step process.*\n\nWhat happens if you _stage_ the files, but don't _commit_ them?\n- Git won't know what files you want to take a snapshot of\n- Git won't take a snapshot of the files.*\n- Git will take the snapshot of the files\n- You will have told Git what files you would like it to take a snapshot of.*\n\nWhat happens if you _commit_ the files, but don't _stage_ them?\n- Git won't know what files you want to take a snapshot of*\n- Git won't take a snapshot of the files.*\n- You will have told Git what files you would like it to take a snapshot of.\n- Git will take the snapshot of the files*\n\nWhich best describes the `-m` flag used when committing changes to a file?\n- a brief description of changes you made to your file*\n- Its just something Git needs so it doesn't break\n- future aids when you are trying to make sense of or recover changes you previously made to a file*\n- It's nonsense—who needs it?!\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Commit](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/commit.md)\n\n# Pushing to GitHub\n\nNow, you may want to backup or share and collaborate around a file on the Internet. Let's connect the directory you created on your local computer to GitHub's cloud service, which you can access through the web.\n\nRemember, GitHub is a service that allows you to host files, collaborate, and find the work of others. Once our syllabus is on GitHub, it will be publicly visible. (Repositories on GitHub can also be private but are public by default.)\n\nGo to GitHub in your browser and click the plus sign in the upper right hand corner.\n\n![You can find the plus sign button to add a repo on the top right of github](/images/git/addrepo.png)\n\nAfter clicking the plus button, select `New repository` from the dropdown menu.\n\n![The dropdown menu where you select New Repository](/images/git/createrepo.png)\n\nAfter clicking `New repository`, you'll have to enter some information, including a name and description for your repository.\n\n![Screen on GitHub where you enter your repository information](/images/git/createrepo2.png)\n\n- Choose a name, such as `git-practice`. (This does _not_ need to match your folder name although it may be less confusing if you choose the same name here.)\n- Enter a description, such as `Test syllabus for learning Git and GitHub`.\n- Keep the `Public — Anyone can see this repository` selector checked. (If you choose the Private option, you will need additional steps, not covered in this workshop, to synchronize your GitHub repository with the folder on your computer.)\n- Do _not_ select `Initialize this repository with a README` since you will be importing an existing repository from your computer.\n- Click `Create repository`.\n\nYou should end up inside your newly created repository. It will look like a set of instructions that you might want to use to connect your GitHub repository to a local repository.\n\nThe instructions we want consist of two lines underneath the heading `...or push an existing repository from the command line`. The hand in this screenshot points to where these directions are on the page:\n\n![The commands you need to copy from the new repo page on GitHub](/images/git/connect-repo.png)\n\nUse the copy button in the top right corner of the code box to copy all three lines of code. They will look something like this:\n\n```console\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git\n$ git branch -M main\n$ git push -u origin main\n```\n\nYou'll need the command copied from your new repository, since it will contain the correct URL.\n\nPaste them into your command line and press enter. You may need to press enter multiple times to run all three lines of code.\n\n```\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git\n * [new branch]      main -> main\nBranch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.\n```\n\nIf you see output like this, go back to your new repository page in the browser and click the `Refresh` button. You should see your `syllabus.md` file on GitHub!\n\n## Review\n\nWe have covered the basic steps of creating a file and tracking changes within a file on your local machine and on GitHub.\n\nThis has involved coordinating across three different environments, so let's go through that one more time. Note that this process is very slightly different. I'll highlight it when it comes up.\n\nTo start, let's add something to our syllabus. Another week of materials or a new reading.\n\nSave that file.\n\nUse `git add` via the command line to stage the file—tell Git what document you want it to pay attention to.\n\nUse `git commit` via the command line to save the changes you've just made as a snapshot or new version of you file. Remember to use the `-m` flag and include a message about the change you just made.\n\nSo far, we have not done anything with GitHub or on the Internet. We have used Git, installed on our local machine, to save a version of file as it stands now. We could stop here if we only had an interest in using Git for version control. But if we also wanted to use GitHub to back up our files, or to share our project with a team or publicly, we want to upload, or push, that repository to GitHub on the Internet.\n\nUse `git push origin main` to upload, or _push_, that file to your repository on GitHub. After refreshing the webpage, your file should appear online. **The difference I noted above appears here.** Note the absense of the `-u` flag from the command. That flag was used the first time to establish the connection between the repository on your local machine and on GitHub. Now that that connection has been established, that flag is not needed.\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. Go through the process a few more times by adding additional readings and weeks of course material. Remember to commit changes intentionally so your commit messages make sense. Use `git log` to review your changes.\n\n2. Also try creating a new file and adding an assignment. Rewrite the assignment using Markdown, or edit and add in the markers. Go through the process of staging and commiting that file, and pushing it to your repository on GitHub.\n\n3. Test your understanding by thinking through the following questions:\n- Do you need to push the file to GitHub each time you commit changes to the file, or can you make several commits to a file and push them all to GitHub at once?\n- Do you need to use `git init` after after adding a new assignment file to your folder?\n- What about the `-u` flag in the `git push origin main` command? Does this flag need to be used to add the assignment to your repository on GitHub?\n\n## Solution\n\nIn response to _Challenge 3_:\n- No, you don't need to push to GitHub every time, or at all even, if you didn't want to share your changes publicly. Git is the software that tracks the changes, and you review them on your local machine using Git as well.\n- No, you don't need to initialize the folder after adding a new file for an assignment or otherwise. In this case, we've already initialized the process; Git is tracking the folder. After the file is added, we just need to notify Git to take a snapshot of the additions and changes using the `git add`, `git commit` sequence. We can also use `git push` to share those changes on GitHub.\n- No, the `-u` flag does not need to be used again. This flag is only necessary when setting up the original connection between the folder on your local machine and the folder on GitHub.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich best describes what you're doing when you use the command `git push`?\n- you telling Git to take a snapshot of changes made to a file.\n- you telling Git which files with changes you want it to pay attention to.\n- you telling git to pay attention to a folder storing files you want to make changes to.\n- you are copying the updated files with the changes to the repository on GitHub*\n\nHow does the process of _pushing_ differ from the processes of _staging_ and _committing_ discussed in the previous lesson?\n- There is no fundamental difference between these processes.\n- Staging and Committing set up the files whereas pushing is the act of taking the snapshot.\n- Staging and committing the files is to communicate with GitHub on the Internet, pushing the changes happens on your local machine.\n- Staging and committing the files happens on your local machine, pushing the changes is to communicate with GitHub on the Internet.*\n\nWhat happens if you use `git push` without staging and committing files?\n- Git won't know what files you want to take a snapshot of.*\n- Git won't take a snapshot of the files.*\n- Your computer won't know what changes to share with GitHub.*\n- Git will take the snapshot of the files\n- You will have successfully created a new version of the file.\n- You will have communicated with GitHub and shared a copy of the updated files.\n\nWhat happens if you _stage_ and _commit_ files, but not _push_ the changes?\n- Git won't know what files you want to take a snapshot of.\n- Git won't take a snapshot of the files.\n- Your computer won't know what changes to share with GitHub.\n- Git will take the snapshot of the files*\n- You will have successfully created a new version of the file.*\n- You will have communicated with GitHub and shared a copy of the updated files.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Push](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/push.md)\n- [Repository](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/repository.md)\n\n# Cloning and Forking\n\nGitHub was built for sharing and collaborating on projects. A key advantage of the platform is that you can find lots of bits of software that do many different things—such as code for plugins for WordPress or Leaflet. Increasingly, you might find syllabi or open writing projects. If a project is public, you can save a copy of it to your local machine, work on it, save your admendations and share it on your own GitHub account. Like we've already mentioned, GitHub usefully helps track attribution along the way.\n\nCloning and forking are the basic functions of this capability. Each are first explained below, and followed by an example and activity to further explain.\n\n## Cloning\n\n**Cloning** a repository means making a copy of a repository on GitHub, to download and work on locally—on your local machine. By entering the following code into your terminal, you can clone any public directory on GitHub:\n\n```console\n$ git clone <repository-url>\n```\n\nWhen you clone a repository from GitHub, the folder that shows up on your local machine comes built-in with a few things. First, Git is already present, so you don't need to initialize the folder. Also, the connection between your local copy and the online repository is already made, so `git push origin main` will work (no `-u` flag needed).\n\nFor practice, let's clone the repository for this workshop about Git and GitHub, which [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git).\n\nFirst, let's navigate back to your Desktop folder.\n\n```console\n$ cd ~/Desktop\n```\n\nRemember that the `~` refers to your home directory. Now let's find the URL we need to clone the lesson.\n\nFirst, visit [this workshop's page on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git).\n\nOn the main page, there should be a green `Code` button on the right side:\n\n![Image pointing out where the clone or download button is on GitHub](/images/git/clone.png)\n\nClick the green button and you will see a box with highlighted text under a heading that says `Clone with HTTPS`. If you instead see `Cloning with SSH`, click the small link that says `Use HTTPS`.\n\nNow copy out the text in the box:\n\n![Image showing where the text you need to copy is located](/images/git/copy-clone-text.png)\n\nNow that you have the text copied, go back to your terminal. Remember, you should be on the `Desktop`. (Hint: Use `pwd` to find out what your current working directory is.)\n\nOnce you are in the `Desktop`, type:\n\n```console\n$ git clone <copied-url>\n```\n\nIf the command is successful, the full Git and GitHub workshop's text will be replicated on your local machine. To navigate into the folder, its name is `git` and you can use the `cd` command to access it:\n\n```console\n$ cd git\n```\n\nUse the `ls` command to take a look at the various files in the lesson folder.\n\nCloning can be especially useful when you're joining a group project that is hosted on GitHub, and you want your changes to eventually be pushed and shared with that same repository.\n\nBut maybe that is not possible or ideal. Maybe you don't want to contribute your changes to someone else's repository. Maybe you want to make a derivative of their folder for yourself, on your GitHub account, and make changes there.\n\nForking is the step you could take to do this.\n\n## Forking\n\n_Forking_ a repository means making a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub, and saving it to your account on GitHub. This function happens within GitHub, and has nothing to do with what is happening on your local machine. Note that _forking_ will not automatically make the repository appear as a folder on your computer; that's the role of _cloning_.\n\nIn order to \"fork\" the `git` repository into your own GitHub account, follow these steps.\n\nFirst, go to [the repository for this workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git). Note the `Fork` button in the upper right hand corner. By clicking that button, you can copy, or fork, this repository to your account.\n\n![Image showing where the button to fork a repo is located](/images/git/fork-button.png)\n\nDoing so would also adjust the attribution information in the upper left hand corner. Your username would replace `DHRI-Curriculum`, showing that you are looking at a copy of the repository on your account now. Additionally, it will reference the origin account, in this case, `DHRI-Curriculum` below after `forked from`, since this was the origin point of _your_ fork.\n\n![Image showing the changes in attribution that happen when a repo is forked](/images/git/forking-attrib-chng.png)\n\nYour local machine would come into play when you want to _clone_ that repository so you can work on it locally. This also means that when you push those changes to GitHub, you would be pushing them to a forked repository associated with your own account.\n\nYou might use this method if you were going to teach your own Git & GitHub workshop. You could use our repository as a base for getting started, and add more examples or change some language, clarify something further, or create a connection to another workshop you are giving, etc. This allows us to continue to use the workshop as we have it as well. Also, maybe at a later time, we want to merge some of your changes with ours. We can do that too by revisiting your version history.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. Fork and clone [the repository for this workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git). Note not only _what_ you are doing, but also _where_ you are working when completing these two different tasks.\n2. Make changes to the files on your local machine. Remember to save them!\n3. Use the 3-step process of stage, commit and push to return the amended files to the repository on GitHub.\n\n## Solution\n\nRather than write out the solution here, I want to encourage you to go back through the lessons as needed.\n\nYou'll know you've completed step one when the project folder (called `git`) shows up on your local machine.\n\nAfter you've made and saved the changes, you'll know you've completed step three when your changes appear in the project folder on _your_ GitHub account.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich best describes _cloning_?\n- Copying a repository from GitHub to your local machine.*\n- Copying a repository from your local machince to GitHub.\n- Copying a repository from someone else's GitHub account to your own.\n- Copying a repository from your account to someone else's account.\n\nWhich best describes _forking_?\n- Copying a repository from GitHub to your local machine.\n- Copying a repository from your local machince to GitHub.\n- Copying a repository from someone else's GitHub account to your own.*\n- Copying a repository from your account to someone else's account.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Cloning](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/cloning.md)\n- [Forking](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/forking.md)\n- [Repository](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/repository.md)\n","title":"Introduction to Git and GitHub","excerpt":"Git and GitHub are powerful tools for collaborative and individual projects.

We know that websites are hypertext, meaning that we can click between links, travelling from page to page until we find what we need. What may be less obvious about websites is that, fundamentally **websites are plain text documents**, usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language, such as XML or XHTML.  \n  \n*Fun fact*: **More than 90% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML**\n[(w3techs.com)](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html/all/all).\n\n## Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)\n\nHTML is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the _content_ of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this information when displaying the document for users.\n\n## Markup Language vs. Programming Language\n\nHTML is a *markup* language, not a programming language. Programming languages are used to transform data, by creating scripts that organize an output of data based on a particular input of data. A markup language is used to control the presentation of data.\n\nFor a practical example of this difference, we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data points, or transform its content into other kinds of data, such as frequencies. A markup language would instead determine the content, layout, and visual presentation of the table.\n\nFundamentally, then, a script or program is a set of instructions given to the computer. A document in a markup language determines how information is presented to a user.\n\n**NOTE—Markup vs Markdown:** Markdown and HTML are both types of markup languages; Markdown is a play on words. Markup languages help format content.\n\n## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\n\nCSS is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document _are_. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should _look like_. It is essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document. Its name—Cascading Style Sheets—refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how the browswer applies CSS rules to a document. More specific rules overwrite less specific rules.\n\n## Where Does the Internet Come In?\n\nTogether, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code) directly from your computer. No internet access needed.\n\nHowever, internet access is necessary if you plan on making your website available to the public. At the end of this workshop, we will briefly discuss [how to get your website from your local computer onto the internet](19-public.md).\n\nIn our activities during this workshop we will focus on building locally-hosted websites. These are websites that you can open on your web browser, however, they only exist on your own device and are only accessible to you. Locally-hosted websites are not yet on the internet. \n\n## Evaluation\n\nTrue or False: The primary difference between markup languages and programming languages is that markup languages are used to determine the format, appearance, and purpose of content, whereas programming languages are used to transform data.\n- True*\n- False\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [CSS](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/css.md)\n- [HTML](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/html.md)\n- [Markdown](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/markdown.md)\n- [Programming Language](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/programminglanguage.md)\n\n# Opening Activity\n\n**_Note_: please use Firefox or Chrome. Safari will not allow you to complete this activity.**\n\n1. Open a web browser, preferably [Firefox](https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/firefox.md).\n2. Go to any website. The example below is from [paramajmera.github.io](http://paramajmera.github.io/).\n3. Open the secondary menu (using a mouse, this would be the menu that opens when you right click on the page; on Mac computers, this is usually a two-finger tap on the track pad, or you can press the <kbd>control</kbd> button then click the track pad).\n4. Select `View Page Source` from the dropdown menu.\n\n![Image showing dropdown menu that appears when right clicking on a website in Chrome or Firefox](/images/html-css/capture.png)\n\n## What You Are Seeing\n\nA second tab should open in your browser displaying the underlying code of the page. This is the code that is used to make and render the page in your web browser.\n\n![Image showing the page source information and underlying HTML code of a webpage](/images/html-css/capture_pageSource.png)\n\nIn this workshop, we are going to learn how to read and write this code, and render it in the browser on your local computer. At the end we will discuss the next steps for how you could host your new website, making it available for browsing by others via the internet.\n\n# Basic Template for HTML\n\nBelow is a basic template for an empty HTML Document.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n    <head>\n        ...\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        ...\n    </body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\nHTML documents start with a `DOCTYPE` declaration that states what version of HTML is being used. This tells the browser how to read the code below it to render the page. If the webpage were written with a different markup language (i.e. XML, XHTML), it would tell you here.  \n  \nAfter the `DOCTYPE`, we see the start of the **Root Element**. EVERYTHING—all content—that you want presented on this page and all information about how you want that information to be organized and styled goes in the root element, and it is demarcated by `<html>` and `</html>`.  \n  \nThe root element begins by indicating which language the document is written in; and in this basic template, `en` tells us and the computer that we are writing in English.  \n  \nWithin the root element of the basic template above, you'll notice the two main sections of all HTML documents: a head section (demarcated by `<head>` and `</head>`) and a body section (demarcated by `<body>` and `</body>`).  \n  \nThe **head section** contains basic information about the file such as the title, keywords, authors, a short description, and so on. This is also where you will link to your CSS stylesheet which describes how you want the page styled—colors, fonts, size of text, and positioning of elements on the page.  \n  \nThe **body section** contains the content of the page, including paragraphs, images, links, and more, and indicates how this content is to be structured on the page.\n\n## Activity\n\nCreate a folder called `htmlpractice` in your projects folder (`~/Desktop/projects/htmlpractice`). Inside that folder, create a new text file and save it as `index.html`.\n\nLet's use the command line to create the new folder and file:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Navigate to your projects folder using this command:\n\n    ```console\n    $ cd ~/Desktop/projects\n    ```\n\n3. Create a new folder:\n\n    ```console\n    $ mkdir htmlpractice\n    ```\n\n4. Use your Visual Studio Code text editor to create a file called `index.html`: `code index.html`.\n5. Paste the template above (starting with `<!DOCTYPE html>`) into the new file.\n\nThe `index.html` file is your default homepage for the website we are creating. This is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the `index.html` page as the opening page to the directory that is your website. See [here](https://www.lifewire.com/index-html-page-3466505) for more explanation.\n\nOnce you've created your new file, open it with a web browser using your graphical user interface:\n\nOn macOS, click on the Finder in your dock (the apps at the bottom of the screen) and click on Desktop on the left. From there, navigate to `projects`, then `htmlpractice`. Alternately, you can click the projects folder icon on your Desktop and find it from there. If you're using a Mac and would prefer to use the command line, you can also type `open index.html` from within your `htmlpractice` folder.\n\nOn Windows, click the `projects` folder icon on your desktop. Navigate to `projects`, then `htmlpractice`. Double click the `index.html` file. If it does not open in a browser, right click the `index.html` icon and select \"Open with...\" from the menu. Select Firefox or Google Chrome from the app list that appears.\n\n## What Happens?\n\nWhen you open the empty template, you'll see only a blank web page. Open your secondary menu (right click on Windows, hold <kbd>control</kbd> and click with macOS) and view the page source.\n\n## What Should Happen When I Open Each of my Two New Files?\n\nWhen you \"View Page Source,\" you should see the code for the basic template.\n\nNo content renders on the page, because there is no content in the template at this time.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich one of these two HTML commands is also known as the \"root element\"?\n- `<!DOCTYPE html>`\n- `<html lang=\"en\">`*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Root Element](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/rootelement.md)\n\n# Tags and Elements\n\nTags and elements are the structuring components of html webpages.  \n  \n**Elements** identify the different parts of a page, such as paragraphs, headings, titles, body text, images and more. Elements are demarcated by tags which enclose the content of an element (ex. `<head>` and `</head>` are tags that denote the head element of your page).  \n  \n**Tags** demarcate elements in one of two ways. As with the paragraph element below, an element can have an opening and a closing tag, with the content in between.\n\n```html\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>\n    This is also a paragraph.\n</p>\n```\n\nElements which have an opening and closing tag can have other elements inside them. Inside the paragraph element below is a `<strong>` element, which emphasizes the included text by making it bold.\n\n```html\n<p>\n    When I came home from school, I saw he had <strong>stolen</strong> my chocolate pudding.\n</p>\n```\n\nOther elements have self-closing tags as with the `<img>` (image) element below. These tags are also called **void tags**.\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image.jpeg\" />\n```\n\nThese elements don't require a separate closing tag. Closing tags aren't needed because you wouldn't add content inside these elements. For example, it doesn't make sense to add any additional content inside an image. It is common practice to end void tags like the one above with a `/` to mark the end of it.  \n  \nBelow is HTML that adds alternative text to an image—or text that describes the image. This information added is an attribute—or something that modifies the default functionality of an element.\n\n```html\n<img alt=\"This is an image\" src=\"image.jpeg\" />\n```\n\nAdding alternative text to an image, as was done in this example, is vitally important. That information makes the image more accessible to those viewing your site. For instance, users with poor vision who may not be able to see your image will still understand what it is and why it's there if you provide alternative text describing it.  \n  \nIf you look back at the basic template in your `index.html` file, you'll see that the main sections of your file have opening and closing tags. Each of these main elements will eventually hold many other elements, many of which will be the content of our website.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich one of the following statements is correct:\n- Elements have opening and closing tags.*\n- Tags have opening and closing elements.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Tag](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tag.md)\n- [Elements](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/elements.md)\n\n# Paragraphs and Headings\n\nParagraphs and headings are the main textual elements of the body of your webpages. Because these contain content that you want to organize and display on your webpage, these are entered in the body element.\n\nThe `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. tags denote **headings** and **subheadings**, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.\n\nThe `<p>` tags denote **paragraphs**, or blocks of text.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n\n    <head>\n        <title>A boring story</title>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <h1>\n            Cleaning my boiler\n        </h1>\n        <p>\n            When I got to my basement that day, I knew that I just had to clean my boiler. It was just too dirty. Honestly, it was getting to be a hazard. So I got my wire brush and put on my most durable pair of boiler-cleaning overalls. It was going to be a long day.\n        </p>\n    </body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\nNote that the `<title>` is in the `<head>` element, which is where information about the webpage goes. The title doesn't appear on the page, but instead elsewhere in the browser when the page is displayed. For example, in Chrome, the title appears on the tab above the navbar.\n\n![Image showing where the title appears in the Chrome web browser](/images/html-css/title.png)\n\nNote also that the elements and tags used in HTML have _meaning_. They provide information about the structure of a web page, showing how its parts work together. Those who make use of assistive technologies such as screen readers rely on this semantic information to navigate the page. Thus, it's important to use elements such as headers only when the information being marked calls for it. Making text large and/or bold for visual effect should be done using CSS. The Mozilla Developer Network has some good [introductory information on semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantics_in_HTML).\n\n## Activity\n\nUsing your text editor, add the following to your `index.html`:\n\n- Title\n- Heading\n- Paragraph\n\nThen, re-save the file. Open it in your browser again or refresh the page if still opened.\n\nWhat do you notice about how the information is organized in the webpage? In other words, where are the title, heading, and paragraph text?\n\n## What Should You See?\n\nThe heading should appear at the top of the page, followed by the paragraph text. The heading text should be larger. The title should appear in the browser window tab.\n\n![Image of the boiler example above rendered in Google Chrome](/images/html-css/boiler-example.png)\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIf I wanted to indicate that \"About\" is a subheading in my page, which element should I use?\n\n- `<head>`\n- `<h2>`*\n\n# Links\n\nLinks are the foundation of the World Wide Web, and thus are an important component of most websites. Hyperlinking text enables users to move between the different webpages on your site (sometimes in the form of a menu or navigation bar), or connect to other resources or information on other websites.  \n  \nThe `<a>` tag, or **anchor tag**, creates a link to another document. You can use the `<a>` tag to link to other documents or webpages you created for the same site or to documents located elsewhere on the web. You can also use it to link to a particular location on a page—we'll see an example of this in the section on Classes and IDs.\n\n## Option One: Relative Links\n\nRelative links take the current page as an origin point and search for other files within the same folder or directory. This method is useful for creating links to pages within your own site.\n\nThe following appears as a link to the `about.html` page in the same folder as `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"about.html\">About</a>\n```\n\nOn your webpage it will appear as:\n\n> [About](#)\n\nThis link is asking the browser to look for a file titled `about.html` in the same folder. If a file named `about.html` is not in the same folder, clicking the link will result in a `404` (\"Page Not Found\") error.\n\n## Option Two: Absolute Links\n\nAn absolute link includes information that allows the browser to find resources on other websites. This information includes the site domain—such as `google.com`—and often the protocol—such as `http` or `https`.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com\">Google</a>\n```\n\nOn your webpage it will appear as:\n\n> [Google](https://www.google.com)\n\nThis pathway is directing your browser to look online for this text document at the URL address provided.\n\n## More on Links\n\nEach example above includes an `href`—a hypertext reference—which is an example of an **attribute**. Attributes offer secondary information about an element.\n\nThe `<a>` tag, or anchor tag, creates a link. The text within the `<a>` and `</a>` tags, the anchor text, is what a visitor to the site will see and can click on. The `href=` attribute tells the browser where the user should be directed when they click the link.\n\nThere is another technical difference between the two options above.\n\n## Relative vs. Absolute Links: When to Use Which One\n\nUse relative links when referring to pages on your own site. The main advantage of using relative links to pages on your site is that your site will not break if it is moved to a different folder or environment.\n\n## Activity\n\n1. Create a new text file called `about.html` in your `htmlpractice` folder. Copy over the HTML from your `index.html` file, but change the text in the `<h1>` element to \"About.\"\n2. In your `index.html` file, add a relative link leading to your \"About\" page.\n3. Also add a relative link from your \"About\" page to your `index.html` page. In this link, call your `index.html` page \"Home\" (Reminder: `index.html` is the default homepage)\n4. Lastly, include an absolute link to a page of your choosing. Remember that an absolute link includes the protocol (for example, `http:`) and also a domain (for example, `cuny.edu`), such as `http://cuny.edu/about`.\n5. Re-save your text files and reopen or refresh them in your browser.\n\n## Check If It Worked\n\nWhen your pages are updated, you should be able to navigate from your \"Home\" page to your \"About\" page, and vice versa. You should also be able to navigate to the external web page.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich one of the following options is a relative link?\n- `<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\">The New York Times</a>`\n- `<a href=\"digitalProject.html\">Digital Project</a>`*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Attributes](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attribute.md)\n\n# Images\n\nImages are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just help bring your website to life, but other times they can help communicate information to users.  \n  \nImages are created with the `<img>` tag. Similar to the `<a>` tag, `<img>` requires an attribute, in this case `src`. The `src` attribute stands for \"source\" and communicates secondary information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. Unlike many other tags, the `<img>` tag does not need to be closed, making it an example of a void tag.  \n  \nThe following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the `.html` file:  \n  \n```html\n<img src=\"scream.jpeg\" />\n```\n\nThe same rules apply here as with the `href` attribute: if the image is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the browser won't find it. If the browser cannot find an image resource, you will see a broken image icon, such as this one from Chrome:  \n  \n![Chrome broken image icon](/images/html-css/broken.png)\n  \nNote: Some sites use a lot of images. When this is the case, it can be helpful to keep images in a separate folder within your site's structure. To enable the browser to find an image in that case, just add the directory in front of the file name. For example, if you have a folder named images in the same folder as your index.html file, and scream.jpeg is in that folder, you'd change the void tag above to `<img src=\"images/scream.jpeg\" />`.\n\n## Making Images Accessible\n\nAs briefly noted earlier, alternative text, or alt text, is descriptive \"text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image\" (see [Wikipedia Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative Text for Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images) for more), and is important for ensuring content conveyed by images is accessible to all.\n\nTo add alternative text to an image, you add an additional attribute, `alt` followed by your descriptive text. For example:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"filename.png\" alt=\"Text in these quotes describes the image\" />\n```\n\nFor more information about using alt text, see what the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/files/SSA_Alternative_Text_Guide.pdf) has to say.\n\n## What Images May I Use On My Site?\n\nIf you're planning to use images that you did not take or make yourself, you'll need to use \"public domain\" or \"open license\" images.\n\nThis [guide by the OpenLab at City Tech](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/following-copyright-guidelines-for-images/) includes more information on licensure and a list of places where you can find reuseable images.\n\n## Activity\n\nDownload and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your `index.html` file.\n\nTip: Give the file a simple name. Also, the name **cannot** have spaces. A good practice is to use either dashes or underscores where there would otherwise be spaces. For example: `this-is-an-image.jpg` or `this_is_an_image.jpg`.\n\nUsing the code above as a reference, add that image into your `index.html` file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. Your image should now appear on the page.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nTrue or False: Does including \"alt text\" in websites improve their accessibility?\n- True*\n- False\n\n# Conventions\n\nAs we’ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you likely have noticed some common conventions or industry standards for creating a webpage using HTML. Can you guess any of these?  \n  \nHere are a few examples:\n\n- Some tags are self-closing, while others require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag. They also generally end with a forward slash (`/`) to mark the end of the tag.\n- Use lower case. While HTML is not case sensitive, it makes scanning the code easier, and makes it look more consistent.\n- Your code should be nested. This is not a technical necessity either—blank space has no meaning in html. However, this makes it easier to scan the code quickly, which is particularly helpful when you run into errors!\n\n# Major Challenge: Create an Institute Website\n\nIn this major challenge, we will begin creating an introductory page for your a Digital Humanities Institute in your home institution. Using the tags we've just reviewed, and two additional ones (see below), we will make a barebones website that provides information about a Digital Humanities Instutite that you might organize.  \n  \nThe first step is to create a new folder called `website` in your `projects` folder on your desktop. Create an `index.html` as well as an `about.html` file inside that folder. These will be the landing page of your site, and a supplemental page that provides information about your Digital Humanities Institute's organizers.  \n  \nAdd HTML to your `index.html` file. This page should include the following:\n\n- Doctype\n- Root element\n- Head and a body\n- Title for the page\n- One heading\n- One paragraph\n- One image with alt text\n- A menu or navigation bar that links to your Home and About pages\n\nThink about the order of your content as you assemble the body of your page. Feel free to make up workshops or borrow language from our [Digital Humanities Institute](https://www.dhinstitutes.org/) website.  \n  \nDon't worry about getting the content just right. The important aspect of this exercise is to review the structure of a webpage, and practice creating a webpage.\n\n## Additional Tags\n\nHere are two additional tags that might come in handy in assembling your page:\n\nTo **make a list**, you open and close it with the `<ul>` tags, and each item is an enclosed `<li>` tag:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n    <li>Item 1</li>\n    <li>Item 2</li>\n    <li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThe HTML above will produce an unordered (bulleted) list. To create an ordered (numbered) list instead, just substitute `<ol>` and `</ol>` for `<ul>` and `</ul>`.\n\n(This may come in handy when making your menu or navigation bar.)\n\nTo **make a line break** or give space between different elements:\n\n```html\n<br />\n```\n\n## Challenge\n\nHere is a more advanced challenge if you're up for it: Add a table containing a schedule of events to your Institute website. You can learn more about making tables using HTML [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp).\n\n# CSS Basics\n\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This language works in coordination with HTML, but is its own language with its own rules and terminology. In contrast to HTML, which is responsible for the content of the page, CSS is responsible for the presentation of the page.  \n  \nExamples of what CSS can help you determine include:\n\n- What background color you want to use for the page or a paragraph.\n- What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text.\n- How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left, or right.\n- Where elements appear on the page.\n- Whether elements are visible to a user or not.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIs CSS a markup language or a programming language?\n- Markup Language*\n- Programming Language\n\n# Integrating CSS and HTML\n\nIn order for CSS to inform the style of the content on the page, it must be integrated with your HTML. CSS can be integrated into your HTML in three ways:\n\n1. inline\n2. internal\n3. external (_recommended_)\n\n## Option 1: Inline\n\nInline styling adds CSS directly into the HTML of a page to adjust the style of particular parts of a page.\n\nFor example, if you want the text of your first paragraph to be red, but the text of your second paragraph to be blue:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <title>About</title>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <p style=\"color: red\">\n            Content of paragraph\n        </p>\n        <p style=\"color: blue\">\n            Content of paragraph\n        </p>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Option 2: Internal\n\nInternal styling also adds CSS directly into the HTML, but keeps it separate from the content code of the page by adding it into the head using the `<style>` tag. When using internal styling you are providing styling rules for the entire page. For example, if you want all headings to be blue:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <title>About</title>\n        <style>\n            h1 {\n              color: blue;\n            }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <h1>\n            Heading One\n        </h1>\n        <p>\n            Content of paragraph\n        </p>\n        <h1>\n            Heading Two\n        </h1>\n        <p>\n            Content of paragraph\n        </p>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Option 3: External (Recommended)\n\nExternal styling creates a completely separate document for your CSS that will be linked to your HTML in the head section of your HTML document using the code below. This separate document is called a _stylesheet_ and is often named `style.css`. The document is linked through a void `<link>` tag that lives inside the parent `<head>` tag. Its `href` attribute is a relative link to the document somewhere in relation to the document that references it.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <title>CSS Example</title>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" />\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        ...\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nIt's best practice to use Option 3, external styling, for a number of reasons:\n\n1. It helps us remember what each language focuses on: HTML is for _content_, CSS is for _styling_. (This is sometimes referred to as the principle of [\"separation of concerns\"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/))\n2. It helps us maintain consistency across the various pages of our site as _multiple HTML files can link to the same stylesheet_.\n3. Because multiple HTML files can link to the same CSS file, it's not necessary to write the same CSS code multiple times. Once suffices. (This is sometimes referred to as the [\"Don't Repeat Yourself\" principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), or simply _DRY_.)\n\nOption 3, external styling, is preferred by most web developers because it's more manageable and because it lends itself to greater consistency across the entire site.\n\n## Challenge: Activity\n\nCreate a blank stylesheet using the command line (following option 3, external styling, described above). In your `index.html` document, link to your style sheet and re-save the file.\n\nTo link your stylesheet with your `index.html` file, insert the following code into the head element of that `index.html` file:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" />\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIs the following code-snippet an example of inline styling or internal styling?  \n  \n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <title>Homepage</title>\n        <style>\n            h1 {\n              font-family: monospace;\n            }\n            p {\n             font-family: fantasy;\n            }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <h1>\n            Online Library for All!\n        </h1>\n        <p>\n            Free books here!\n        </p>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n- Inline Styling\n- Internal Styling*\n\n# Rule Sets\n\nCSS is based on selectors and declarations, which together form rule sets (or just \"rules\"). Rule sets comprise an external styling file with a `.css` extension. Here is the contents of a sample `.css` file:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    color: orange;\n    font-style: italic;\n}\n\np {\n    font-family: sans-serif;\n    font-style: normal;\n}\n\n#navbar {\n    background-color: yellow;\n    padding: 80px;\n}\n\n.intro {\n    font-family: arial;\n    background-color: grey;\n    color: dark-grey;\n}\n```\n\nThe first rule (which starts with the `h1` selector) applies to all `<h1>` tags on each page where your HTML document links to your stylesheet, and changes the font style and display of those headings.  \n  \nThe lines within the curly braces (i.e. `{ ... }`) are called **declarations**, and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each line in the declaration sets the value for a **property** and ends with a semicolon (`;`).  \n  \nNote the different syntax being used to select items for for styling with rule sets. The bottom two selectors are used to apply rule sets to **IDs** and **classes**. In general, adding classes and IDs to HTML elements allows for more specific styling—more on these soon!\n\n## Challenge\n\nCopy and paste the CSS rules above into your `style.css` file and re-save the file. Then open or refresh your `index.html` file in your browser and see what happens.  \n  \n**What should happen?**  \n  \nThe formatting of the text on your page should change accordingly. Your `<h1>` should be orange and italic, for example.  \n  \nWhat are some other rules you might set for different HTML elements? Do a quick Google search for a CSS rule that changes the appearance of your page, such as putting a border around an element.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nHow do we associate a CSS file with an HTML page?\n- By including a link to the CSS file in the HTML page's `<head>` element.*\n- By putting the CSS file in the same folder as the HTML page.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [CSS Selectors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/cssselectors.md)\n- [Class](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/class.md)\n- [ID](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/id.md)\n\n# Filtering\n\nSome of you may be wondering whether it matters what order you add the rule sets to your `style.css` document. The answer is no. CSS has an automatic filtering function where **the most specific rule in CSS always takes precedence.**  \n  \nSo if your stylesheet contained the following rule sets:\n\n```css\np {\n    color: green;\n}\n\np strong {\n    color: red;\n}\n```\n\n...then the text of your paragraph would be green, but where the strong tag is found in the paragraph, the text would be bold and red. In other words, the more specific styling for the `<strong>` text in your paragraph will override the less specific styling of the paragraph in general. This would occur **regardless of the order these rule sets appear in the stylesheet.**  \n  \nThis rule also applies to how you integrate CSS into your HTML to style your content. For example, if you link to an external stylesheet, and you add inline or internal CSS into your HTML, the inline or internal CSS will override the rules set in the external stylesheet. Similarly, the inline CSS will override the internal CSS.\n\n# Classes and IDs\n\nClasses and IDs enable more fine-grained styling by allowing you to define your own selectors. The difference between classes and IDs is that IDs are unique, used to identify one specific element or part of an element, whereas classes are used to identify multiple instances of the same type of element.  \n  \nBasically, if you're styling a part of your page that is unique, such as the navbar or footer, use an ID. If you're styling something that recurs in different places, like an info box or form field, use a class.  \n  \nIncorporating classes and IDs into the styling of your document includes two steps:\n\n1. Some HTML code that CSS selectors can refer back to must be added to your HTML document.\n2. CSS rules that select that code must be added to your style sheet.\n\nThe code for classes and IDs is different in both CSS and HTML.\n\n## HTML Code\n\nIn HTML, classes and ids are added to the first part of a tag. Here's an example of what HTML code with classes and ids looks like:\n\n```html\n<ul id=\"navbar\">\n    <li>Home</li>\n    <li>About</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h1 class=\"football\">Football teams</h1>\n\n<ul>\n    <li class=\"football\" id=\"colts\">Indianapolis Colts</li>\n    <li class=\"football\" id=\"packers\">Green Bay Packers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h1 class=\"baseball\">Baseball teams</h1>\n\n<p>American League teams</p>\n<ul>\n    <li class=\"baseball american\" id=\"twins\">Minnesota Twins</li>\n    <li class=\"baseball american\" id=\"tigers\">Detroit Tigers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>National League teams</p>\n<ul>\n    <li class=\"baseball national\" id=\"dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</li>\n    <li class=\"baseball national\" id=\"mets\">New York Mets</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nNote that it's possible to assign more than one class to an element—just leave a blank space between the two classes, as in the baseball examples above.\n\nBonus: ID selectors can be used to create links that can be used for navigation _within_ a page. For example, to add a link to the page that takes the user directly to the line that reads \"New York Mets,\" we might write a HTML link like this: `<a href=\"#mets\">Mets</a>`.\n\n## CSS Selectors\n\nClass selectors in CSS are denoted with a period in front of the class name you're creating. They look like this:\n\n```css\n#navbar {\n    padding: 80px;\n    background-color: red;\n    color: white;\n}\n\n.football {\n    font-family: arial;\n    background-color: lightgrey;\n    color: blue;\n}\n\n.baseball {\n    font-weight: bold;\n    color: green;\n}\n\n.american {\n    background-color: yellow;\n}\n```\n\n## ID Selectors\n\n...look like this in the CSS—the name of the selector preceeded by a hashmark (`#`) (also known as a pound sign or octothorpe):\n\n```css\n#navbar {\n    background-color: yellow;\n    padding: 80px;\n}\n```\n\n...and in the HTML they are incorporated into elements like this:\n\n```html\n<ul id=\"navbar\">\n    <li>Home</li>\n    <li>About</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n## Tip\n\n_If you run into an error, be sure to check your punctuation. Oftentimes the problem is a typo, or overlooking a semi-colon, a period, etc._ See the [Troubleshooting](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/html-css/lessons/?page=17) section for more information on common issues.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nTrue or False: Classes are used to create categories of related elements, IDs are used create unique identifiers.\n- True*\n- False\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [CSS Selectors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/cssselectors.md)\n- [Class](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/class.md)\n- [ID](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/id.md)\n\n# Useful Properties\n\nBelow is a list of useful properties that can be modified with CSS, compiled by Digital Fellow [Patrick Smyth](http://smythp.com). There are also [CSS cheatsheets](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/cheat-sheets/css-cheat-sheet.pdf) available online.\n\n## Color\n\nDetermines text color. Can be a word or a hex value, like `#FFFFFF`:\n\n```css\ncolor: blue;\ncolor: #000000;\n```\n\n### Background Color\n\nSets the background color of an element.\n\n```css\nbackground-color: pink\nbackground-color: #F601F6;\n```\n\n### Text Align\n\nAligns text to the left, center, or right.\n\n```css\ntext-align: center;\n```\n\n### Padding\n\nThe space between contents and the \"box\" (`<div>`) surrounding it.\n\n```css\npadding: 10px;\npadding-right: 10px\n```\n\n### Margin\n\nThe space between an element's box and the next element (or the edge of the page).\n\n```css\nmargin: 10px;\nmargin-top: 10px;\n```\n\n### Width and Height\n\nSets the width or height of an element. Typically, don't set both of these.\n\n```css\nwidth: 50%;\nheight: 40px;\n```\n\n### Float\n\nDetermines if text wraps around an element.\n\n```css\nfloat: left;\n```\n\n### Display\n\nDetermines if an element is treated as a block or inline element. Can also be set to `none`, which makes the element disappear.\n\n```css\ndisplay: inline;\ndisplay: block;\ndisplay: none;\n```\n\n### List Style\n\nDetermines default styling on lists. Usually best to set it to `none`.\n\n```css\nlist-style-type: none;\n```\n\n### Font Family\n\nSets the font. Usually best to copy this from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or another web font repository.\n\n```css\nfont-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;\n```\n\n# Major Challenge: Styling Your Institute Website Using CSS\n\nUsing the CSS basics we've just reviewed, and the list of properties found on the [Properties page](15-properties.md) and online, give your website some styling.  \n  \nI encourage you to use an external stylesheet with classes and IDs to style particular aspects of your site more specifically, but feel free to also play around with inline and internal styling if desired.\n\n- Change the color and size of your heading text.\n- Change the font of your paragraph text.\n- Change the background color of your navigation bar or menu.\n- Center your image on your page.\n- [Shape up your navigation bar.](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/html-css/blob/v2.0/sections/_navbar-hint.md)\n  \n**Reminder:** After creating a stylesheet, you must link it to all HTML documents that you want this styling to apply to. You can do so with the `<link>` tag:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\" />\n```\n\nThis will tell your HTML document to apply the style rules from the text file named `style.css` in the same folder.\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\nIt is common—especially in the beginning—that you'll add or amend something to/in your text editor, but it won't present when rendered by your browser.  \n  \nYour first inclination should be to scan the text in your editor for errors. Nesting will help tremendously with this task. Oftentimes it is as little as forgetting a semicolon or closing tag.  \n  \nAnother investigative tactic is to **View Page Source** on the page opened in the browser.  \n  \nIf you think it is an **error with the HTML**, you'll be able to see it there.  \n  \nIf you think it is an **error with the CSS**, then from the Page Source you'll need to click on the link for the `style.css` page. The link to this page should be found in the head of your page. Don't see it? That may be the problem! If you do see it, open the link to see what CSS the browser is reading and applying to your HTML. It should match what you have in your text editor. If it looks like an earlier version of your style sheet, then maybe you need to re-save the document.\n\n# Workshop Summary\n\nThrough this workshop, you have learned the basics of two of the most commonly-used languages for building on the web: HTML and CSS.  \n  \nHTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, organizes content on your page using elements denoted by tags (`<...>`). When rendered by your browser, these tags tell your browser that certain content is paragraph text, while other content is heading or title text, and so on. You can also use image (`<img>`) and link or anchor (`<a>`) tags to tell the browser to render an image on the page, or take the visitor to another page on your or another website. We also discussed some important conventions to consider when creating HTML documents, such as nesting.  \n  \nCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows for further styling of your website through the application of a series of rule sets that are applied to different aspects/elements of your site. In order for CSS to render on a webpage, it must be integrated with your html, which can happen in three ways: inline, internal, and external. CSS rules can be of varying specificity, and in particular, through creating classes and IDs. We also discussed how the ordering of rule sets doesn't matter, because an important function of CSS is the way it filters and applies rules in accordance with the specificity of the rule.  \n  \nThrough understanding these languages in combination with one another, you can also reframe your understanding of the web—not as _poof! magic!_, but as a series of intentionally styled, hyperlinked text documents, with each website representing a folder of documents.  \n  \nWhile this is a good starting point, one important question remains: how can I get these text documents on the Internet so they can be accessed, and interacted with, and linked to by others? This is what we will discuss in the final lesson of this workshop.\n\n# Making your Website Public\n\nGreat job! Now you have an amazing website, but it's stuck on your computer where no one else can find it or view it. How do you get your website onto the Internet so it can be shared?  \n  \nTo get your site on the internet, you'll need **hosting**—that is, a remote computer that will stay on day in and day out to serve the website to visitors. In theory, you could host your website on your own computer, but in practice, it usually makes sense to purchase hosting from a hosting company or use a free service.  \n  \nYou'll also need a way of getting your website to your host. That's where FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, comes in.\n\n## FTP\n\nFTP is a protocol used to share files from your computer (_a client_) to another computer called a server, and back again over the Internet. This is something we do _all the time_, but we refer to it as \"uploading\" and \"downloading.\"  \n  \nNote: Though FTP stands for file transfer protocol, you are not really transfering or moving your files from your computer; instead they are _copied_ to the server. Fear not!  \n  \nIn order to transfer your website files (also called your website's directory) to a server you will need:\n\n1. Access to the Internet.\n2. An FTP Client.\n3. A server that is connected to the Internet where you can send your files.\n\nAssuming you all can manage accessing the internet on your own, let's focus on the latter two.\n\n### FTP client\n\nAn **FTP client** is software designed specifically for the purpose of sharing files between computers. There are widely-used, freely-available GUI applications (i.e., applications that use a graphic user interface, or the point-and-click, user-friendly software interfaces you are used to) that you can download for use, including [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) and [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/). You can also run an FTP client program through the command line on most computers, though the process varies by operating system.\n\n### Other Resources about FTP\n\n- [FTP for Beginners, *Wired*](https://www.wired.com/2010/02/ftp_for_beginners/)\n- [The Three Best FTP Clients for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-ftp-clients-windows/)\n- [How To Use FTP Through the Command Line in Mac OS X](http://www.techradar.com/how-to/software/operating-systems/how-to-use-ftp-through-the-command-line-in-mac-os-x-1305664)\n- [How to Use the Mac Terminal as an FTP or SFTP Client](https://beebom.com/how-to-use-mac-terminal-ftp-sftp-client/)\n\n## Web Hosting\n\nYou also need a server to transfer your files to, where they can be stored and shared on the Internet. This is what we call **web hosting** and there are multiple options here as well. The GCDI (CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives) website contains a list of [low-cost cloud hosting services for students](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-resource-guide/#cloud). As long as your site is just plain HTML and CSS, it's also possible to host your website for free on services such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\n\n### Guides to Web Hosting Services\n\n- [The Best Web Hosting Services](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-web-hosting-services/)\n- [Top 7 Easy and Free Web Hosting Services](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-7-easy-and-free-web-hosting-services/)\n- [10 Ways That Free Web Hosting Is Bad for Your First Website](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-web-hosting-is-bad/)\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [FTP](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/ftp.md)\n- [Web Hosting](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/webhosting.md)\n","title":"Introduction to HTML and CSS","excerpt":"HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create and organize the content of a website.

This first part of the workshop is a very quick overview of mapping concepts to help orient you to the process of mapmaking.\n\n![An example of a Points, Lines, and Polygon Map](/images/mapping/pointslinespolygonsmap.png)\n\nIn this map of the United States we see three basic shapes—the cities are represented by points, the main rivers are represented by lines and the states are represented by polygons. While this is a very simple map, most maps that you've seen, even the most intricate ones only consist of these three basic shapes—points, lines and polygons. This type of mapping data is called \"vector data.\" Vector data can be stored in several file formats with the most common being a \"[shapefile](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/shapefile.md).\"\n\n## Features and Attributes\n\nAnother mapping concept that's important to know is that the visualizations that are displayed on the map are called the map's \"[features](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/feature.md)\" and the data that's connected to those shapes are called the maps \"[attributes](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attribute-table.md).\" Attribute data is stored in an attribute table, which is a lot like spreadsheet. One feature on the map can contain many attributes—the feature for the state of Florida has the attributes `STATEFP` (the state ID), `STUSPS` (the state abbreviation), `NAME` (the state name), etc. Any type of data that you have at the scale of the state can be put in this attribute table. The attribute table stores all of the data and then you decide what data you want to visualize.\n\n![Screenshot explaining the concepts features and attributes in mapping](/images/mapping/featuresattributes.png)\n\n## Sidebar: Raster Data\n\nThere is another important type of data that we will not be using in this workshop, but you should be aware of. It's called \"raster data.\" Raster data is an image, such as a satellite image, with \"geolocations\"—which just means location data. It's beneficial to store geographic data as raster data when you are working with continuous data, such as heat or elevation.<!-- TODO #12: add \"raster data\" to glossary -->\n\n![An example of a Polygon Map](/images/mapping/polygonsmap.png)\n\n![An example of a Line Map](/images/mapping/polygonslinesmap.png)\n\n![An example of a Points, Lines, and Polygon Map](/images/mapping/pointslinespolygonsmap.png)\n\nVoilà!\n\n## Evaluation\n\nVector data consists of?\n- points*\n- pixels\n- lines*\n- polygons*\n\n## Keywords\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Vector](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/vector.md)\n- [Raster](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/raster.md)\n- [Shapefile](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/shapefile.md)\n- [Features](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/feature.md)\n- [Attributes](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attribute-table.md)\n\n# Mapping Tools\n\nThere are a few questions to consider that will help you choose the right tool for mapping:\n\n- **Static or Interactive?** Do you want a static map, such as a high quality image that can be published? Or do you want an interactive web-based map?\n- **What is your budget?** Can you only rely on free tools or do you have some money to put towards your mapping project?\n- **What is your time commitment?** Do you have the time to learn higher level mapping skills, which is better for doing a spatial analysis, or do you want a tool that can allow you to make a map quickly because you just want to visualize spatial data?\n- **Will you be working in a team?** Might you need a shared platform for creating your map?\n\nBoth ArcGIS and QGIS are software that you download onto your computer and can be used to perform spatial operations (analyze and manipulate your data), and make composite maps. Here is a quick comparison of the two.\n\n![Chart that compares ARCGIS and QGIS](/images/mapping/toolscomparison.png)\n\nFor this workshop we will be using QGIS to perform spatial operations on our data. This is because QGIS is free and open source! However, since QGIS doesn't offer a way to make interactive maps, we will need a separate tool for that. ArcGIS does offer an online version that can be used to make interactive maps, but the limitation is that you need a paid subscription if you want to perform spatial operations. So for this workshop we're going to do a little hack in which we use two different mapping tools so we can have a completely free experience :) We will use QGIS to perform spatial operations. And then we will export the data and upload it into ArcGIS Online to make our interactive map.\n\nHere is a quick comparison for some of the mapping software that you can use to make an interactive map.\n\n![Chart that compares interactive map tools](/images/mapping/toolscomparison2.png)\n\nThe only option that is truly free is Leaflet, but it requires familiarity with coding. You can read more about the benefits and limitations of these tools in the blog post [\"Finding the Right Tools for Mapping\"](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2019/06/03/finding-the-right-tools-for-mapping/) on the Graduate Center's Digital Fellows blog.\n\n## Challenge\nA friend looks over your shoulder as you are going through the workshop. They ask, \"Why are you using two different mapping softwares?\" How would you respond?\n\n# Ethics of Mapping\n\n\n![Quote: \"Maps are embedded within power relations and mediate those relations through spatial representations — Pavlovskaya, M.E. (2006)\"](/images/mapping/quote1.png)\n\nIn introduction to mapping courses we are often told that every map starts with a lie—that the earth is flat. From the first step of having to choose a mapping projection and decide on which types of inaccuracies you would be willing to sacrifice, the process of mapping is filled with ethical choices. Over the years, many of these decisions have been obscured through a greater reliance on technology. Today, (far too many) mapmakers allow the software to make decisions for them. However, whether these are active or passive decisions, they are still decisions that affect the map and the viewers interpretation of the map.\n\n![Image providing examples of ways that maps can be projected from the earth's round surface onto a two-dimensional surface](/images/mapping/mapprojections.png)\n\nMaps are powerful. The cartesian map which divides the world into coordinates has its origins as being a tool for nation-state building and colonialism. Due to this history, maps are often seen as authoritative and therefore representing objective Truth. Being a cartographer comes with a lot of responsibility. Still today, once you display something in the form of a map it's rarely questioned for its veracity. And yet, the real Truth is that all maps only represent partial truths.\n\nSo much of the mapping process is dependent on the positionality of the mapmaker and all of the subjective decisions that they must make when deciding what will be mapped, how the data will be manipulated, and how it will be visualized.\n\n# Ethics of Mapping Continued: Questions to Consider\n\nImportant ethical decisions that every mapmaker must consider are:\n\n- **What data should I use?** If you choose to use data that's already collected (e.g. Census data), are you using it because it's the easiest to access or because it's the most appropriate data to answer your research question? What are the limitations of using data that hasn't been collected or managed by you?\n- **How should I classify the data?** What categories will you create? For example, if you are working with racial demographics, will you report on the categories such as Latinx, non-Latinx White, non-Latinx Black, Latinx White, Latinx Black, etc, or will you provide broader categories such as people of color and white? What are the implications of choosing more general categories?\n- **At what resolution or scale should the data be aggregated?** If you are studying a phenomena at the neighborhood level, how do you define the boundaries of a neighborhood? Is it based on the school district, the Census Designated Place (CDP), the voting district, or maybe a boundary that doesn't have a formal delination, such as a sense of community among people?\n- **What are the implications of aggregating the data at a certain scale?** For example, let's say you are studying the differences between urban and suburban areas. If you aggregate your data at the level of counties, what could be missing from that representation of the data? Is something happening at the level of the neighborhood or town, which could prove useful to answer your research question? This is not to say that the smallest scales are always the best to work with, but rather to suggest that when we aggregate data, we need to be aware of what distinctions we are hiding in the process.\n- **What colors and symbols should I use?** Should you represent a population in red or blue? Red normally signals something that is alarming, while blue is a more neutral color. These subjective cartographic design decisions greatly impact viewer's understanding of the map.\n\nFor more guiding questions on ethical decision making, please see [\"Ethical Decision-Making\"](https://serc.carleton.edu/geoethics/Decision-Making), a robust resource put together by the \"Community of Earth Educators.\"\n\n![Quote: \"We conceive 'mapping' as a practice, an action of thought in which the map is only one of the tools promoting an approach and deep analysis of social, subjective, and geographic territories.\" (Dúo Iconoclasistas)](/images/mapping/quote2.png)\n\nWith all of the subjective decisions that go into mapmaking, those working in the tradition of feminist GIS and critical cartography have stressed the importance of contextualizing one's map. Maps do not speak for themselves. We need to add context that allows the viewer to understand all of the decisions that were made while making the map. This form of transparency will help tell the story that you are trying to communicate.\n\n## Further Resources\n\nFor more about the history of mapping, and to learn about current countermapping projects, see these resources:\n\n- [Manual of Collective Mapping](https://www.academia.edu/28625755/Manual_of_Collective_Mapping_Critical_cartographic_resources_for_territorial_processes_of_collaborative_creation_2016_). Critical cartographic resources for territorial processes of collaborative creation.\n- [Counter Mapping: Zuni Maps](https://emergencemagazine.org/feature/counter-mapping/).\n\n## Challenge\n\nHave a look at [this map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) of vaccination by county and state. Imagine the map in red instead of green. Do you think that might shift some people's feelings towards the vaccine, even if on a subconscious level? Also, have a look at the two different maps--one aggregated by county and the other by state. How does the level of aggregation change what the map tells us?\n\n# Making an Interactive Map: Introduction\n\nEvery map should start with a good research question. But what makes for a good mapping research question? The key, I find, is to start with a simple, answerable question. It's often the case that a seemingly simple and boring question can lead to bigger and more interesting questions. However, if you start with the big, complex question, it could be too overwhelming. So start small and then build on your question, if needed. Also, what do I mean by \"answerable\"? In the mapping world, this can mean several things. It could mean a question that can be answered by using preexisting data or data that can realistically be collected by the mapmaker. Suppose you want to map how Americans in different counties feel about a certain issue, but that national survey hasnt been done and you don't have the resources to do it, then this would fall under the category of an unanswerable question. Also if you want to map boundaries that havent been created, such as homeschool pods, then this might be an unanswerable question (again if you don't have the resources to create the boundary from scratch).\n\nBy these standards, for this workshop we have a simple, easily answerable question.\n\n\n## Research Question\n\nDo Black Lives Matter protests tend to take place more in majority Black neighborhoods, perhaps as a tactic to build solidarity, or in majority non-Black, perhaps as a tactic to raise awareness?\n\n## Exploring the Data\n\nWhat kind of data do we need to make this map?\n\n- **Location of protests.** This data didn't exist, so I had to create it. I tried to find all of the protests that took place from May 28, 2020 to June 3, 2020. Since this was based on my own ability to capture the data from news articles, I assume that there are protests that happened during that week that are not in my dataset. When I publish my map, it will be important to state this assumption and include the methodology for how this data was collected.\n- **Shapes to represent the neighborhoods.** For NYC neighborhoods we can download a shapefile (which is a form of spatial data) from NYC Open Data. The file can be [downloaded here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTA-/cpf4-rkhq). Click on \"Export\" and select \"Shapefile\". A compressed folder will download. Move the folder out of your downloads and into a folder on your computer were you will be keeping all of the data for this workshop. When you open the folder you will notice there are four different files in there that all have the same name, yet are a different file type. In order for a shapefile to work, all of this data needs to stay together. Please compress the folder, so that the entire folder can be uploaded into our mapping software when we are ready to use it.\n- **Census data on race by neighborhood.** Census generated demographic data can be downloaded as a CSV file from the Census website. I've already downloaded the spreadsheet and cleaned it up for us so that it only has the variables that we are interested in—`GeoName` (neighborhood name), `GeoID` (a unique identifier for each neighborhood), and `BINHP` (Percent Black). You can find this file [here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/mapping/blob/v2.0/dataset/racebyneighborhood.csv)\n\n## Preview the Result\n\nTo get a better idea of what we will be building together, you can take a look at a final version of the [Location of BLM Protests Map](http://arcg.is/1KyC9O).\n\n# Combining Data Through a Spatial Join\n\n![Image detailing the process of combining data in a \"spatial join\"](/images/mapping/data.png)\n\nSince our neighborhood data are in two separate files, we'll need to perform a \"spatial join\" to combine them into one file. During the spatial join we will add the data on percent black by neighborhood that's in our CSV to the neighborhood shapefile, which is a polygon layer. Remember that only vector data (points, lines and polygons) or raster data (pixels) is geographic data. Also, remember that vector data is typically stored as a shapefile, so when you have a shapefile, you know it's geographic data. A CSV is not geographic data, even if it might have geographic data in it, such as addresses. A CSV is a text file, so it needs to be combined with geographic data to be visualized on a map. This is why we will need to use a *spatial join*.\n\n## What's a \"Spatial Join\"?\n\nWell, I'm glad you asked because a [*spatial join*](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/spatialjoin) is one of the most common GIS operations! There are two types of spatial joins--*spatial join by attribute* and *spatial join by location*. Both of them are ways that the mapping software will let you add data from one map layer or file to another map layer. A *spatial join by attribute* is used when you want to join non-spatial data, such as a text file, to spatial data, such as a shapefile. A *spatial join by location* is used when you want to join two layers of spatial data (e.g. a points layer to a polygon layer). Let's say you are working with the map of the U.S. used in the introduction and you want to aggregate information at the city level (the point layer) to the level of the state (the polygon layer). For this you will use a *join by location* since you are comparing two layers with spatial data.\n\nSince we are joining a CSV file (non-spatial data) with a shapefile (spatial data) we will need to use a *join by attribute*.\n\nIn order to do this both files need to be the same resolution (e.g. NYC neighborhood). A [resolution](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/resolution.md) is the scale at which the data is aggregated and displayed. Additionally, both files need to have a column with the same unique identifiers—this will serve as a key to match the two data files. When you work with data from the government, such at Census data, each geographical unit (e.g. each different neighborhood) will be given a unique identifier, so if both your data and your shapefile are from the government then the unique identifiers will match.\n\nNow that we have the concepts for what a spatial join means, we can move on to performing the spatial join on our data.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nA spatial join by attribute is used when you want to join which combination of layers:\n- spatial data to non-spatial data*\n- spatial data to spatial data\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Spatial Join](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/spatialjoin) \n- [Polygon](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/polygon.md)\n- [Resolution](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/resolution.md)\n\n# Performing a Spatial Join\n\nWe will use QGIS which is a free and open source mapping software that will allow us to do pretty much any spatial operation that you could ever want! If you haven't yet installed QGIS you can do so by following these [installation instructions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/main/sections/qgis.md) \n\n## Open QGIS\n\nFirst, go ahead and open QGIS. When you open the application, you'll see an interface that looks like this:\n\n![Screenshot overviewing QGIS's interface](/images/mapping/qgisinterface.png)\n\n## Adding Demographic Data to QGIS\n\nLet's add our data that needs to be joined. Follow the steps below to help you through the process.\n\n1. To add our [CSV](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/csv.md) of demographic data, `racebyneighborhood.csv`, open the **Data Source Manager**—this button is located in the top left corner of the interface and looks like three pieces of colored paper stacked on top of each other.\n2. When the Data Source Manager is open, select the **Delimited Text** option.\n3. On the right side of the **File name** section, click on the three dots to locate the file. Then click **Add**.\n\n![Screenshot of QGIS's data source manager](/images/mapping/datasourcemanager.png)\n\nYou should now see the file appear in your Layers panel. You'll also see that nothing happens in your map display panel; this is because a CSV file is a text file. Remember that only vector data and raster data has features that can be mapped. A CSV file by itself is not mappable. That's why we need to combine it with the neighborhood shapefile. Note that if you happen to have precise location data in your CSV, such as addresses or latitude and longitude coordinates, the mapping software will be able to read it and convert it into vector data through a process called *geocoding*. When you don't have precise location data, you will need to use a *join by attribute* to add the text data to a shapefile. \n\n## Adding Vector Data from Our Shapefile to QGIS\n\nNow let's add our shapefile of New York City:\n\n\n1. Go back to the **Data Source Manager** and this time select **Vector**.\n2. Under **Source type**, the \"file\" option should be selected.\n3. Where it says **Vector datasets**, use the browse feature again to find the shapefile on your computer and click **Add**.\n\n![Screenshot of adding vector layer](/images/mapping/addvectorlayer.png)\n\nNow you should see that the file shows up in your Layers Panel, and it also displays as a map layer on your display panel.\n\n## Inspecting the Attribute Table\n\nLet's look at the data in the attribute table to see what we're working with. Each file has its own attribute table, so let's look at them one at a time. To do so, right-click on the `racebyneighborhood.csv` file and select \"Open attribute table.\" _If you see the three variables—`GeoName`, `GeoID`, and `BINHP`—then we're good to go!_\n\nLet's open the attribute table for the \"Neighborhood Tabulation Area\" shapefile. Right-click on that layer and select \"Open attribute table.\"\n\n![Screenshot of attribute table](/images/mapping/ntaattributetable.png)\n\nIn the table, you will see the variables: `boro_code` (borough code), `boro_name` (borough name), `county_fip` (the unique identifier for each county), `ntacode` (the unique identifier for each neighborhood), `ntaname` (neighborhood name), `shape_area` (surface area of each neighborhood in decimal degrees) and `shape_leng` (the length of the perimeter of each neighborhood in decimal degrees).\n\nYou will notice that both files have a variable in common—the `ntacode` in the shapefile is the same as the `GeoID` in the CSV file. These two variables will serve as our keys that will be used to match and join the files together.\n\nA spatial join won't work unless the fields are the same [data type](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attributetype.md) —integer, double, string, etc. To see the field type, double-click on each layer and navigate to the \"Fields\" tab. The `ntacode` and the `GeoID` are both string variables, so we are all set for our join.\n\n## Performing a Spatial Join\n\nNow we are ready for our spatial join!\n\n1. In the layers panel, double click on the shapefile layer, \"Neighborhood Tabulation Area\".Then click on **Joins** and click on the **green plus sign**. A new dialog will appear on the screen. This is where you will configure your spatial join.\n2. Select `racebyneighborhood` for the **Join layer** option since that is the map layer you are joining to the neighborhood shapefile.\n3. Select `GeoID` for the **Join field** option.\n4. The **Target field** should be `ntacode`.\n5. Where it says **Custom Field Name Prefix**, you can click the checkbox and change the prefix. This prefix will be added to the variable name of every join layer. You can change it to something shorter or you can simply delete the text so no prefix is added. I'm going to delete mine.\n6. Lastly, click **OK** to save the configuration of the spatial join.\n7. To run the join, click **OK** in the following dialog.\n\n_Note: `GeoID` and `ntacode` are the two variables that match from the two mapping layers. This is why we are using them in step 3 and 4 above as the **Join field** and **Target field**._\n\n![Screenshot detailing the steps in this section to perform a \"spatial join\"](/images/mapping/joins.png)\n\nTo check to see if the join was successful, we'll need to look at the neighborhood shapefile's attribute table and see if the variables from the CSV file are there.\n\nRight-click on the shapefile layer and select **Open attribute table**. If you scroll to the right you should see the three variables from the CSV file—`GeoName`, `GeoID`, and `BINHP`. If you see them, then you've successfully completed a spatial join!\n\nSince our shapefile layer has been updated with new data, lets rename it. To do so, right-click on the shapefile layer in the Layers Panel and select **Rename**. I'm going to rename mine `NYCntaPerBlack`. This name will let me know that the data has New York City neighborhood tabulation areas and percent black.\n\n## Recap: Two Different Types of Spatial Joins\n\nMapping softwares typically offer two different types of spatial joins—join by attribute and join by location.\n\n- **Join by attribute** is the type of join what we just did; it’s based on matching two layers based on a shared attribute or variable.\n- **Join by location** is when you have two shapefiles that you want to combine based on where the features are located on the map. For example if you have a map of US states and you want to add information about its cities, you can run a spatial join by location. To learn more about this type of join, check out [How Spatial Join Works in GIS by GIS Geography](https://gisgeography.com/spatial-join/).\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe *Data Source Manager* is used to:\n- import files into QGIS*\n- organize data files\n- stack map layers\n- export map layers\n\nWhat's needed to perform a *spatial join by attribute*:\n- There must be a column in both datasets that matches and will serve as a key to link the two datasets.*\n- The columns that serve as a key must be the same data type.*\n- The text file must have precise location data, such as an address or latitude and longitude.\n\n## Keywords\n- [Spatial join by attribute](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/joinbyattribute.md)\n- [Spatial join by location](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/joinbylocation.md)\n\n\n# Exporting Data from QGIS\n\nNow our neighborhood shapefile (containing the demographic information) is ready to be exported from QGIS and uploaded into ArcGIS Online where we will be able to turn it into an interactive map.\n\n## Preparing for the Export\n\nSince shapefiles are actually a set of 4-6 files, it's helpful to create a folder for them so they don't get mixed up with your other files. So, before we export the shapefile file, let's create a folder for it. \n\n1. Create a new folder somewhere on your computer where you are keeping the data for this workshop.\n2. Let's name the folder `NYCntaPerBlack.`\n\n## Exporting the Data\n\nNow we're ready to export the data.\n\n1. In QGIS, right-click on the neighborhood shapefile in the Layers panel. Then select **Export** and **Save Features As**.\n2. Under **File name** we need to tell QGIS which folder to export the file into. Use the three dots to navigate to the folder `NYCntaPerBlack`\n3. Next, you can click off the check box at the very bottom of the \"Save Vector Layer as…\" configuration box, where it says **Add saved file to map**. Since we already have this as a map layer in QGIS, there's no need to add it as another layer in the software.\n4. You can leave everything else in the configuration alone. Lastly, click **OK** to complete exporting the data.\n\n![Screenshot detailing the steps above to export the shapefiles for the project](/images/mapping/exportnew.png)\n\nNavigate to your `NYCntaPerBlack` folder and check to see if all of the shapefiles are in there. There should be around 4–6 files in the folder. If there are, then your export was successful.\n\nThe last thing we have to do is **compress** the folder. ArcGIS Online will only import compressed shapefiles. If you're working on a Mac, right-click on the `NYCntaPerBlack` folder and click **compress**. If you're on a PC, right-click on the `NYCntaPerBlack` folder and select Send to and then **Compressed (zipped) folder**.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhy do we create a folder for the exported shapefile?\n- The export won't work without it.\n- Shapefiles are actually 4-6 files, so it's a way to keep them organized and prevent accidentally separating them.*\n- ArcGIS will only import compressed shapefiles, so we need to create a folder to compress or zip the file.*\n\n# Importing Data to ArcGIS Online\n\nNow we will be using ArcGIS Online to make the map interactive. Remember that we could have done everything in ArcGIS if we had the paid version, but since we are working with the free public version we cannot perform any spatial operations, such as the spatial join that we just did. That's why we used QGIS first. Now that we have the data exactly how we want it, we can use ArcGIS for free to visualize the data and create an interactive map.\n\n## Login to ArcGIS Online and Setup Interface\n\nFirst, you'll have to set yourself up with a free ArcGIS Online public account. To do so, open [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com), and click \"Sign in.\" If you don't already have an account, you can create one for free using your email, or your Google, Facebook or Github account.\n\nOnce you've logged in, let's open a new map project by selecting \"Map\" in the main menu.\n\nLet's get acquainted with the interface.\n\n![Screenshot detailing ArcGISOnline's interface](/images/mapping/arcgisinterface.png)\n\n## Create a New Map and Add Your Data from QGIS to ArcGIS\n\nNow, let's import and format our neighborhoods shapefile.\n\n1. Click on **Add**.\n2. Click **Add Layer from File**.\n3. Select **Choose File**. Then navigate to where you have the compressed `NYCntaPerBlack` file saved on your computer.\n4. Select \"Generalize features for web display\". I've tried making maps with both this option and \"Keep original features\" and I've never noticed any difference. \n  - ArcGIS describes the benefits of this feature the following way: Generalizing reduces the precision of the shapefile layer to approximately 1 meter in Web Mercator and will remove vertices within 10 meters in Web Mercator. This should maintain an informative and accurate display of your features while reducing the overall size of your data and allowing your layer to quickly display in the map.\n\n\n6. Click **Import Layer**.\n\nYou should now see something that looks like a map of New York City, where some automatic attribute (for example, borough) has been chosen by ArcGIS for coloration. In the example below, ArcGIS has automatically selected borough as an attribute to color on the map.\n\n![Screenshot detailing what the map's styling looks like after the steps above](/images/mapping/shapefileimport.png)\n\n# Changing the Map Style\n\nLet's change the attribute so that the colors represent the percentage of Black population in New York City's neighborhoods.\n\n1. Under **Choose an attribute to show**, select `BINHP` which stands for Black Non-Hispanic Population.\n2. Click around with the Drawing Styles to see which you think works best. I would suggest using the first option, a choropleth map style that shows the value by the intensity of the color.\n\nLet's change the color to something that makes sense.\n\n1. In the **Counts and Amounts** (Color) box click **Options**.\n2. Click **Symbols**, and change the color. I'm selecting the black/white color ramp since I think it fits in with the story I'm trying to tell.\n3. Once you've chosen your [color ramp](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/colorramp.md), click **OK**.\n4. Optional: You can click on **Classify** if you want to change how the data is visualized and how many categories are created. \"Natural breaks\" is a good option because it increases variability between classes while decreasing it within classes.\n5. Click the **OK** button at the bottom of the Layers Panel.\n6. Finally, click **Done** to save your changes to the map. If you don't click Done, it will revert to what you had before.\n\nYou should now see your maps styled with your new color ramp. You'll also see the `NYCntaPerBlack` map layer in the Layers Panel.\n\n![Screenshot that shows what the map looks like after the steps above](/images/mapping/colorrampchange.png)\n\n## Challenge\n\nPlay around with the symbology settings more. See how the map looks when you change the transparency, the number of classes and other features. To go back to the symbology settings, hover over the name of the map layer in the layers panel and select the *change style* button (the one with with three shapes--circle square and triangle). Then click *Options*.\n\n## Keywords\n- [color ramp](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/colorramp.md)\n\n\n# Configuring the Pop-up\n\nIf you click on your map, you'll see a pop-up window with all of the information contained in the attribute table.\n\n![Screenshot that shows what the automatic pop-up window looks like in ArcGIS Online](/images/mapping/uglypopup1.png)\n\nAs you'll see, the pop-up doesn't look very nice. The names won't make much sense to the map viewer, and the viewer probably wouldn't be interested in some of the information, like the `ntacode`.\n\nLet's configure our pop-up so that it looks better and provides more useful information.\n\n1. In the map's Layers Panel, **hover over** where it has the name of the shapefile `NYCntaPerBlack`, and you will see some options appear below it—\"Show Legend\", \"Show Table\", \"Change Style\", and \"More Options.\"\n2. Select **More Options** by clicking the three dots below the name of the map layer.\n3. Select **Configure Pop-up**. The Layers Panel will turn into a panel for configuring the pop-up.\n\n![Screenshot detailing the three steps above on the ArcGIS Online interface](/images/mapping/configurepopup.png)\n\nLet's explore the options that we have for the pop-up.\n\n1. The first thing you'll see is a checkbox for turning on and off the pop-up. We're going to leave ours on.\n2. In the **Pop-up Title**, you can enter a name that will be displayed at the top of every pop-up box. You can type in something. Or you can have one of the attributes displayed. Let's have the neighborhood name displayed in the pop-up title. To do this, **click the plus sign** to the right of the text box and select `ntaname`. Next to `ntaname`, write \"(Black%). Now the title will show the name of the neighborhood and the text \"(Black%)\".\n3. In the **Display**, select the drop-down to see the list of options. The options for what you can display in the pop-up are \"A list of attributes\", \"A description from one field\", \"A custom attribute display\", and \"no attribute information\". We are going to select **A description from one field** since we are only interested in showing the value for Percent Black. Then in the next drop-down **select `BINHP`**.\n4. Then click **OK** to save our changes.\n\nNow when you click on the map you should see a popup with just the name of the neighborhood plus the text \"(Black%)\" and then in the box you will see the value for Percent Black.\n\n![Screenshot that shows what the map and the pop-up looks like after the steps above](/images/mapping/configurepopup2.png)\n\n# Importing CSV file and Geocoding Addresses\n\nNow we're ready to import our next mapping layer. This one will be the CSV file that we have of several BLM protests that took place during one week in June. We want to layer this data as points. The point layer will be displayed over the polygon map layer to see if the protests tended to take place in neighborhoods that were majority Black, or not.\n\nLet's import the file.\n\n1. Select **Add**.\n2. Select **Add Layer from File**.\n3. Select **Choose File**, and navigate to where you have the file `1 Week of Protests.csv` saved on your computer.\n4. Select **Import Layer**.\n\nAt this point a box should appear that says \"Add CSV Layer\" at the top and has information about location, coordinates and addresses.\n\n![Screenshot that shows ArcGIS Online's \"Add CSV Layer\" dialog](/images/mapping/addcsv.png)\n\nThis is the ArcGIS's way of asking you if you want to convert the addresses that are stored in the CSV file into points on the map. This process is called \"[geocoding](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/geocoding.md).\" Geocoding is a spatial process that uses a *geographic address locator* to match addresses with location coordinates and create a point layer. It turns a text file (CSV) into a vector file (points layer). This process will only work if you have addresses or coordinates stored in your CSV file, and luckily we do! If you open the CSV file in a spreadsheet manager, you'll see that we have the fields `address`, `city`, `state` and `zip`. This is all the *geographic address locator* will need to be able to locate the address for each protest and create a map layer of points.\n\nTo geocode the CSV file, the **Field Name** column (pulled from the CSV file) needs to match with the **Location Fields** column (which is the geocoder column). Make sure that the following fields match:\n\n1. Field Name: Address = Location Fields: Address or Place\n2. Field Name: City = Location Fields: City\n3. Field Name: State = Location Fields: State\n4. Field Name: Zip = Location Fields: Zip\n\nIf they don't match, then click on the cell(s) to change it. Most likely, since the mapping software is pretty good at this stuff, they will all be automatically matched, so you won't have to change anything. Finally, click **Add Layer**.\n\n## Note on Geocoding Limits\n\nNote: ArcGIS will only geocode up to 100 entries. If you have more than 100, you can use the Census Geocoder which allows you to geocode up to 1000 entries.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n- [geocoding](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/geocoding.md)\n\n# Changing the Style of the Points Layer\n\nNow you should see a series of points on top of the neighborhood map layer. ArcGIS Online will automatically use an attribute to style the point layer. In my example, it automatically chose \"Start location.\"\n\nLet's change the style of the points layers so that the symbology is not based on an attribute. I'm not really interested in displaying any particular attribute along with the protests. I just want to see the location of the protests.\n\n1. Under **Choose an attribute to show**, select \"Show location only.\"\n2. Now let's change the color of the points. In the box that says Location (single symbol) choose **OPTIONS**.\n3. Select **Symbols**.\n4. Feel free to play around with the options for the style of the point. You can change the shape, the fill color, the outline, and the size. You can even upload your own image. For mine, I chose an orange star that's size 12.\n5. Select **OK**.\n6. And select **OK** again.\n7. Finally, select **DONE** to save your changes.\n\n![Screenshot detailing what the point layer looks like once it has been formatted according to the points above](/images/mapping/protestsformatted2.png)\n\nWith this map, we should already be able to answer our research question. We wanted to know if there might be a relationship between the location of BLM protests and the racial demographic of the neighborhood, specifically if the neighborhood is majority Black. Here we can already see little correlation between the location of the protests and the racial demographic of the neighborhood. We can observe, however, that many of the protests are taking place in centrally located places in Manhattan and in some parts of Brooklyn. If we click on the points, we'll also see that many of the location starting points are popular sites and meeting places, such as Times Square, Union Square, and Bryant Park.\n\n## Challenge\nPlay around with the symbology settings a bit more. See what happens when you change the *visible range*. What do you think this option is for? For the answer check out [this article](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/set-visibility.htm).\n\n# Formatting the Pop-ups for the Protest Locations\n\nLet's format the pop-ups for the protest locations so that the map viewer can learn more about the sites. The attributes that can be displayed are: \"Date\", \"Start Location\", \"Address\", \"City\", \"State\", \"Zip\", \"Photo\", \"Details.\"\n\nOut of these options, let's display the \"Start Location\", \"Photo\" and \"Details.\"\n\n1. In the **Map Layers Panel**, hover over where it has the name of the points layer \"1 Week of Protest\" and select the three dots for **More Options**. Then select **Configure Pop-up**.\n2. In **Pop-up Title** write \"BLM Protest\"\n3. In **Display** select \"A list of field attributes.\"\n4. Select **Configure Attributes**.\n\nNow you should see a dialog that looks like this:\n\n![Screenshot that shows the dialog for formatting the map's protest layer according to attributes](/images/mapping/popupprotest1.png)\n\nHere, you can decide which attributes to display by clicking the checkboxes under the **Display** column. You can also edit the **TextBox Type** by having the checkboxes under the **Edit** column selected. Lastly, you can change the name that appears for the attribute in the pop-up. To do this click on the words in the column **Field Alias** and it will allow you to put in new text. Let's try some of these options.\n\n1. In the **Display** column select \"Start Location\" and \"Details.\" Even though we also want to add \"photo\" we are not going to check that off here. Media needs to be configured through a different process, which we'll do next.\n2. You don't have to change anything in the **Edit** column.\n3. Under Field Alias click on the word **Details** and change it to \"Protest info.\"\n4. Click **OK**.\n\nNow let's add our photo to the pop-up. Under **Pop-up Media** select **Add < Image**. You should see the following dialog:\n\n![Screenshot that shows the dialog that allows for us to format the image shows in the map's pop-up](/images/mapping/configureimage.png)\n\nLet's try some of the options that are available to us.\n\n1. In **Title** delete the text and leave it blank.\n2. Leave the Caption blank.\n3. For the **URL**, click the plus sign and select \"Photo\". You might have to scroll down to find it in the list of attributes.\n4. Click **OK**.\n5. Click **OK** again to save your changes.\n\nNow you should see a nicer looking pop-up when you click on the points on your map. Some points don't have any \"Protest info,\" but for all of them you should see the \"start location\" and photo.\n\n![Screenshot showing what the pop-up looks like after following all the steps in this section](/images/mapping/finalpopupdone.png)\n\n# Formatting the Legend\n\nA map legend is a visual explanation of the symbols used on the map. It typically includes a sample of each symbol (point, line, or polygon), and a short description of what the symbol means. \n\n![Screenshot that shows where the legend is located in the ArcGIS Online interface](/images/mapping/viewlegend.png)\n\nLet's have a quick look at the legend to make sure that it will be informative for our map viewer.\n\n1. In the Map Layers Panel, at the top, you should see three icons—an \"i\" with a blue circle around it, followed by a paper with blue writing, and then a bulleted list. Click on the icon that looks like a bulleted list; that's the legend icon.\n2. I think the legend generally looks okay, but it currently displays the name of the map layer, which can be a little confusing for the viewer, especially the layer `NYCntaPerBlack`. Let's rename the layers so it will be easier for the viewer to understand.\n3. Go back to the Map Layer panel where you can see the hyperlinked layers. You can do this by clicking the icon that looks like a white sheet of paper with blue writing.\n4. Then click on the three dots for **More Options** and select **Rename**.\n5. Do this for both layers to rename them something that's easier to read. I'm going to name mine \"BLM Protests (May 28 to June 3, 2020)\" and \"NYC Neighborhoods by Percent Black.\"\n\n# Saving and Sharing Your Map\n\nNow it's finally time to save and share your map!\n\n1. To save the map, click the **Save** button (with the floppy disk icon). Enter your title, tags, and summary to describe the map. Then click **Save Map**.\n2. To share your map, click on the **Share** button (with the chain link icon).\n3. Click the checkmark next to **Everyone (public)** so that you can share the map with the public. Once you do that, all of the share options will become available to you, including sharing the URL to the map or getting embed code to put the map on a website.\n\n![Screenshot detailing the steps in this section and where they are located in the ArcGIS Online interface](/images/mapping/savemap.png)\n\nCongratulations! You've made an informative and interactive map with two layers of spatial data, multiple pop-ups, and even multimedia with your pop-ups!\n","title":"Mapping Workshop","excerpt":"In the past decade, interactive maps have become one of the most popular ways to visualize and explore spatial data.

Mapmakers need to decide what data to represent and what to leave out. They also need to decide how to aggregate, categorize, project, combine, and visualize the data. All of these decisions will influence the story that the map tells. Additionally, as a critical tool of Western colonialism and imperialism, maps wield great authority. As mapmakers, it's essential to be conscious of this history not to reproduce harmful power dynamics through mapmaking. Once something is visualized in the form of a map, it is often understood as a Truth representation of reality. Therefore, mapmakers have an important responsibility to be as honest and transparent as possible. Since the 1980's, there have been two emerging disciplines in academia—critical cartography and feminist GIS—that have brought to light many of the harmful applications of mapping. Rather than reject mapping, they have made significant contributions to the field of GIS and mapping, such as counter mapping, sketch mapping, participatory mapping, qualitative GIS and 3D body-mapping.

To that end, all of the Python programming you will learn about can be done here, __directly in your browser__. Throughout the workshop, you will encounter several designated code sections in which you can write and run your Python code. These emulators are meant to allow you quick and easy access to coding principles. However, there are many ways to interact with Python, and you will also learn about how to interact with your Python installation locally on your machine. \n\nWith that said, let's get started!\n\n## The Interactive Session\n\nOne of the most basic ways to interact with Python is through an \"interactive session.\"  This is a special space that allows us to run little one-line bits of Python, experimenting and exploring what it can do, without having to save it. Think of this interactive space as a playground. Later on, we will be working with Python in a more robust way, executing longer Python scripts.\n\nAn interactive session, otherwise known as the __REPL__ (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), is a basic environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the results to the user. A typical REPL environment in the terminal looks as follows:\n\n```pycon\nPython 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34)\n[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>>\n```\nAs you can see, it first shows the current Python version along with some hints for help or licensing information. Next, you will see three very important greater-than signs: `>>>`. \n\nThese greater-than symbols `>>>` are how you know that you have entered an interactive session with Python, as distinct from the normal `$` terminal prompt (or `%` if you are on MacOS). Let's work with this environment a bit.\n\n## A Little Math\n\nLet's try a little math in the Python prompt. In the Python REPL environment below <span style = \"color:green\">(shown in green text)</span>, type the following mathematical operations after the Python prompt (the `>>>`), and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> or <kbd>return</kbd> after each operation.\n\n- `>>> 2 + 3`\n- `>>> 14 - 10`\n- `>>> 10 * 10`\n- `>>> 6 / 3`\n- `>>> 21 % 4`\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\nThe first four operations above are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. The last operation is _modulo_, or mod, which returns the remainder after division.\n\nNote the way you interact with Python at the prompt. After entering an expression such as `2 + 3`, Python \"evaluates\" it to a simpler form, `5`, and then prints out the answer for you. **This process is what is meant by the Read Eval Print Loop, or REPL**. Reading takes commands from you, the input is evaluated or run, the result is printed out, and the prompt is shown again to wait for more input.\n\nThe REPL is useful for quick tests and, later, can be used for exploring and debugging your programs interactively. As mentioned, you might consider it a kind of playground for testing and experimenting with Python expressions.\n\n## Opening the REPL in the Terminal\n\nAlthough we have provided you with an emulated REPL environment to work with here in your browser, you can also begin an interactive session locally in your own computer's terminal or command prompt. If you have Python installed, you simply need to open your terminal and type:\n\n```console\n$ python\n```\n\nat the prompt and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>. This will start the Python REPL environment, and you can interact it with it just as you did with the math example above. You can get out of Python by hitting <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> (or <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> or <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> if you're on a computer running Windows) or by typing `exit()`. You can get back in the REPL again by typing `python` at the regular `$` prompt. Just remember that you're in the Python REPL when you see `>>>`, and you're in bash or your terminal when you see the `$`.\n\n## Challenge\n\nOne operator (math symbol) we didn't learn is the exponent—e.g., \"x raised to the power of...\" If you were Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, how would you define this operator?\n\n## Solution\n\nThe exponent operator is two asterisks (`**`). For example, the number `3` to the power of `2` would be expressed as `3**2`.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat are the characteristics of the REPL? Select all that apply.\n\n<Quiz>\n- The REPL has a prompt that begins with `$`.\n- The REPL has a prompt that begins with `>>>`.*\n- The REPL and the terminal are the same thing.\n- The REPL can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions like `2 + 2`.*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [REPL](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/REPL.md)\n\n# Types\n\nTypes are classifications that let the computer know how a programmer intends to use a piece of data. You can just think of them as, well, types of data.\n\nWe've already seen one type in the last section with our math examples: the integer. In this section, we'll learn four more: the floating point number, the string, the boolean, and the list.\n\nIn the Python REPL environment below, write the following commands one line at a time, hitting <kbd>enter</kbd> after each to see the result.\n\n- `>>> type(1)`\n- `>>> type(1.0)`\n- `>>> type(\"Hello there!\")`\n- `>>> type(True)`\n- `>>> type([1, 2, 3])`\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\nWhat do you suppose is happening here? Well, each of the responses show how the different types of data register as different \"types\" for Python:\n\n**Integers** (like `1` above) are whole numbers.\n\n**Floats** (like `1.0` above) are numbers with decimals, and are treated a little differently than integers.\n\n**Strings** (like `\"Hello there!\"` above) are arbitrary sets of characters, such as letters and numbers. You can think of them as a way to store text.\n\n**Booleans**: (like `True` above) is a fancy term for values representing \"true\" and \"false,\" or \"truthiness\" and \"falsiness.\" In Python they are always capitalized: `True` and `False`.\n\n**Lists**: (like `[1, 2, 3]` above) are ordered collections of values. You can put any of the other types in a list: `[\"hello\", \"goodbye\", \"see ya later\"]` is also a valid list.\n\nDon't worry about trying to actively remember these types. We'll be working with each in turn in the following sections.\n\n## Challenge\n\nUsing the Python REPL, find __1)__ the type of `(\"12\")`, and __2)__ the type of `([\"dog\", 13, 3.0])`. What do you think the results will be for each?\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\n## Solution\n\n__1)__ Writing `type(\"12\")` will return the type of `string`. While `12` is an integer, enclosing a number within quotation marks will result in a type of `string`. __2)__ Writing `type([\"dog\", 13, 3.0])` will result in a `list`. Individually, while `\"dog` is a string, `13` is an integer, and `3.0` is a float, putting these elements together in brackets results in a `list` object being returned. As you can see, a `list` can contain items of different types.\n\n## What's the deal with type()?\n\n`type()` is a function. You can think of functions in Python in a few different ways:\n\n1. A way of doing something in Python.\n2. A way of saving some code for reuse.\n3. A way of taking an input, transforming that input, and returning an output. The input goes in the parentheses `()`.\n\nThese are all valid ways of thinking about functions. We'll be learning more about functions in later sections.\n\n## Challenge\n\nOpen your web browser, and google the phrase \"python function.\" Skim through the first few results. What words do you recognize, and which ones look unfamiliar? What do you think the unfamiliar ones mean? Try to rephrase some of this new language, and guess what they mean in your own words.\n\n## Solution\n\nWhen you google \"python function,\" you may see some phrases that look unfamiliar, like \"return value\" or \"pass parameters.\" These are advanced terms for inputting and outputting data from a function. It's important to become familiar with the Python's terminology about functions, as it will be helpful later on when you start working with these components.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSelect all the following that accurately describe the data type categories.\n\n<Quiz>\n- Booleans represent only `True` or `False` values.*\n- Integers can be expressed with numbers like `1` or letters `one`.\n- Strings can contain numbers within quotations, like `\"1\"`.*\n- Lists can contain strings, like `['banana, 'coffee', 'eggs']`.*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Boolean](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/boolean.md)\n- [Float](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/float.md)\n- [Integer](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/integer.md)\n- [String](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/string.md)\n- [List](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/list.md)\n- [Type()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/type.md)\n- [Function](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/function.md)\n\n# Variables\n\nA variable is **a symbol that refers to an object**, such as a string, integer, or list. Try each of the following commands in order in the Python REPL below, hitting <kbd>enter</kbd> after each:\n\n- `>>> x = 5`\n- `>>> x`\n- `>>> y = \"hello\"`\n- `>>> y`\n- `>>> y + \" and goodbye\"`\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\nAs you can see from the examples above, the `=` sign lets you assign symbols like `x` and `y` to data.\n\nVariables can be longer words as well, and they can be set to lists. For instance, type the following into the REPL:\n\n- `>>> books = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia','Living a Feminist Life']`\n- `>>> books`\n- `>>> type(books)`\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\n...you can see that we have assigned the `list` variable `books` three different book items to work with.\n\nVariables can have letters, numbers, and underscores, **but should generally start with a letter**.\n\nIf you are curious about learning more about naming conventions for variables, you can check out the PEP8 style guide's section on [Naming Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions). PEP8 is the widely accepted guide for Python programmers everywhere.\n\n## Challenge\n\nSo I just told you that variables shouldn't start with a number. What does that even mean? Will your computer explode if you write `1_book = \"Gender Trouble\"`?\n\nOnly one way to find out. Try giving weird names to variables and see if you can learn a bit about the rules:\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\n## Solution\n\nThere are a few rules regarding the way that you write the variable statement. This is because Python reads everything left to right, and needs things to be in a certain order.\n\nFirst, you cannot use any numbers or special characters to start a variable name. So `1_book`, `1book`, or any variable that contains special characters `@`, `#`, `$`, `$`, etc, wouldn't be acceptable in Python. You must start the variable with a letter and avoid using special characters.\n\nYou can incorporate numbers after you've started with a letter. So `book_1` or `b1` is acceptable, though you cannot use special characters at any point in the variable name.\n\nSecond, you might also notice that variable syntax requires you to write the variable name first, followed by an equal sign `=`, and then the value, or data. You cannot start the variable statement with the data value, because Python always recognizes the first thing written as the thing to be assigned. The thing that comes after the `=` is the data that becomes attached to the preceding variable.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSelect all the variable expressions that are allowed in Python.\n\n<Quiz>\n- `1 = one`\n- `one = 1`*\n- `$$$ = \"dollar_signs\"`\n- `first_book = \"Orlando\"`*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Variables](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/variables.md)\n\n# Running Scripts\n\nSo far, you've interacted with Python one line at a time in the REPL. This is what we call the Interactive Mode, which is, as we mentioned, like a playground for experimenting and exploring different Python expressions, such `2 + 2` or `type(\"some stuff\")`. The code that we write in the REPL is not saved after you exit the terminal, which means that this space is for running Python expressions and *not* for writing longer programs.\n\nFor the rest of this session, we're going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with a code editor, where we write out lengthier Python scripts.\n\n## Your First Script\n\nIn the code editor below, write the following line and click `RUN` to execute the code:\n\n- `print(\"Hello World!\")`\n\n<CodeEditor>\n</CodeEditor>\n\nYou should see the text `Hello World!` appear in the output below the code editor.\n\nCongratulations! You've written your first script. That's a big deal!\n\n## Running A Script Locally with the Terminal and a Text Editor\n\nWhile we have provided you with a code editor to work with here in the browser, when programming your own projects you will likely be working with a text editor and the terminal installed locally on your machine. First, let's begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as Visual Studio Code) and create a new file with this line:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\n```\n\nSave it with the name `hello.py` to a known location, such as your desktop. Open your terminal and move to the desktop directory:\n\n```console\n$ cd Desktop\n```\n\nOnce you're in the folder with your `hello.py` file, move to the terminal. Do *not* enter the Python Interactive Mode (the REPL), which is unnecessary to run python scripts. Instead, lookout for the `$` symbol that lets you know you're in the terminal. (If you find yourself in the Interactive mode (`>>>`), then try exiting it with <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>. You should see the `$` symbol, letting you know you're back in the terminal. If you still do not see the `$` symbol, type `exit()` followed by <kbd>enter</kbd> after the Python prompt, `>>>`.)\n\nNow that you're in the terminal, type the following, and press enter:\n\n```console\n$ python hello.py\n```\n\nYou should see the text `Hello world!` appear as output in the terminal.\n\n__Note:__ You might have noticed some suggestions pop up when you were typing in the code editor. This is a handy feature called \"code completion\", which is the computer trying to understand what you are typing and giving you quick suggestions. Many code editors have this feature and it can be useful to save you time and help you understand what a particular function needs as parameters.\n\n## A Note on Text\n\nFundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like Visual Studio Code or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There's nothing special about `.py` files—they're just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you can learn through the DHRI Curriculum—the command line, Git, markdown, grep—are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.\n\n## Challenge\n\nRewrite your program so that you assign the \"Hello World!\" message to a variable, then print the variable. This will make your program two lines instead of one. There's a fancy programmer word for rewriting your code without changing its behavior—\"refactoring.\"\n\n<CodeEditor></CodeEditor>\n\n## Solution\n\nYour code should look something like this:\n\n```python\ngreeting = \"Hello World!\"\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nThen, when you run the code, you should see the following output:\n\n```console\nHello world!\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat are the differences between the terminal, REPL, and text editor? Select the correct statement from the below options.\n\n<Quiz>\n- You can run scripts from the **terminal** that were written on the text editor. *\n- The **REPL** allows you to save scripts for later use.\n- The **text editor** allows you to test code on the fly.\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [REPL](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/repl.md)\n- [Scripts](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/scripts.md)\n- [print()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/print.md)\n\n# Errors in Python\n\nOur usual response when seeing an error on a computer screen is a stress response. Our heart rate elevates and, if we cannot do what we were asking the computer to do, our frustration mounts. This is because many errors when interacting with programs are not useful or informative, and because we often have no capability to fix the program in front of us.\n\nIn Python, errors are our friends. This might be hard to accept initially, but the errors you see when running Python scripts generally do a good job of pointing you to what's going wrong in your program. When you see an error in Python, therefore, try not to fall into the stress response you may be used to when interacting with your computer normally.\n\n## Two Kinds of Errors\n\nIn Python, there are two kinds of errors you will encounter frequently. One appears before the program runs, and the other appears during the execution of a program.\n\n**Syntax errors**: When you ask Python to run a program or execute a line in the REPL, it will first check to see if the program is valid Python code—that is, that it follows the grammatical or syntactical rules of Python. If it doesn't, before the program even runs, you'll see a syntax error printed out to the screen.\n\nAs an example, type the following in the Python REPL below:\n\n`print('This string has mismatched quotes.\")`\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\nYou should receive an error:  `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`, which points out that our line has faulty syntax. Note the caret (`^`) underneath the mismatched quote, helpfully pointing out where the error lies. Similarly, if this error happened when running a script, Python would tell us the filename and the line number for the line on which the error occurs.\n\n**Traceback errors**: These errors occur during the execution of a Python program when the program finds itself in an untenable state and must stop. Traceback errors are often logical inconsistencies in a program that is valid Python code. A common traceback error is referring to a variable that hasn't been defined, as below.\n\nAs an example, type the following in the Python REPL below:\n\n`print(not_a_variable)`\n\nYou should receive a Traceback error, indicating that we have not declared the variable `not_a_variable`. Traceback errors try to tell you a little about what happened in the program that caused the problem, including the category of error, such as `NameError` or `TypeError`.\n\n## Debugging\n\nDebugging is a fancy word for fixing problems with a program. Here are some common strategies for debugging a program when first learning Python:\n\n__If the error is a syntax error:__\n\n1. Look at where the caret is pointing.\n2. Pay attention to grammatical features such as quotes, parentheses, and indentation.\n3. Consider reading the program, or the offending line, backward. It's surprising, but this often helps to detect the issue.\n\n__If the error is a traceback error:__\n\n1. First look at the line where the error occured, then consider the general category of error. What could have gone wrong?\n2. If the error is a name error (NameError), check your spelling.\n3. Try copying the last line of the error and pasting it into Google. You'll often find a quick solution this way.\n\nIf you changed the program and expect a different output, but are getting old output, you may not have saved the file. Go back and make sure the file has been correctly saved.\n\n## Challenge\n\nIn the Python REPL below, try to create as many errors as you can in the next few minutes. After getting your first two syntax errors, try instead to get traceback errors. Some areas to try include mathematical impossibilities and using math operations on types that do not support them.\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\n## Solution\n\nSome examples of **syntax errors** include...\n\n- Starting the variable name with a special character:\n\n```pycon\n>>> %greeting = \"Hello World\"\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    %greeting = \"Hello World\"\n    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\n- Starting a variable by writing the data values before the variable:\n\n```pycon\n>>> \"hey there!\" = greeting\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1\nSyntaxError: can't assign to literal\n```\n\n- Including spaces in a variable:\n\n```pycon\n>>> pleasant greeting = \"Hello!\"\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    pleasant greeting = \"Hello!\"\n                    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nSome examples of **traceback errors** include...\n\n- Concatenating data types, like strings and integers:\n\n```pycon\n>>> greeting = \"hello\" + 1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n```\n\n- Using Booleans (`True` or `False`) without capitalizing them:\n\n```pycon\n>>> greeting = false\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'false' is not defined\n\n>>> greeting = False\n\n>>> greeting\nFalse\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIf you get an error, what can you do to debug it? Select all that apply:\n\n<Quiz>\n- If it's a _syntax error_, look for the caret as a starting point.*\n- If it's a _traceback error_, make sure all your variables are defined.*\n- Copy the error message into a Google search.*\n- Run spell check on your code.*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Syntax Errors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/syntax_error.md)\n- [Traceback Errors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/traceback_error.md)\n\n# Functions\n\nBroadly defined, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Often, a function takes an input, transforms the input, and returns an output. Imagine, for instance, a [penny press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongated_coin) at a popular tourist attraction that accepts a penny (the input), flattens and embosses the penny (the transformation), and spits out an elongated coin with a new design, perhaps an image of the Statue of Liberty (the output)! Or, for those of you who remember high school algebra, the function `f(x) = x + 1` means that given an input `x`, the function will return `x + 1`. For example, if I substituted `2` for `x`, my function would read `f(2) = 2 + 1`, or `f(2) = 3`. In this case, my input was `2`, the transformation was to add `1`, and the output was `3`. These are the basic concepts that make up a function in Python as well! \n\n## Writing your first function\n\nLet's write a Python function that prints the output from our algebraic equation `f(x) = x + 1` above. Try running the code in the editor below. (If you accidentally modify the code, you can hit the `REVERT` button to reset it.)\n\n<CodeEditor>\ndef add_one(x):\n  print(x + 1) \nadd_one(2)\n</CodeEditor>\n\nAs output, you should get the number `3`. Let's break this code down to understand how it works.\n\nFirst, we create a function:\n\n```python\ndef add_one(x):\n  print(x + 1)\n```\n \n When creating a function, we begin by writing `def` before our chosen function name. The function name is typically descriptive in nature. We named the above function `add_one` following [Python naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names), as the function will be ADDING 1 to our inputted integer. We always need a closed parentheses `()` after our function name, which in this case, takes one argument (or input), which we will temporarily call `x` (we can name this parameter whatever we want, as long as we use the same name within the body of the function). Then, we end the first line with a `:`, return, and indent by 2 spaces to write code describing what this function should \"do.\" In this case, we want the function to `print` the result of adding `1` to our input, or `x`. Remember, we need parentheses every time we print something!\n\nNext, if we want to call our function, we will need to actually pass in an argument to see a result. To do so, we write the following line of code below our function (making sure this next line _isn't_ indented):\n\n```python\nadd_one(2)\n```\n\nHere, we are telling the computer to pass in `2` to see if we get our expected output of `3`.\n\n### Optional \n\nTo see the magic of the function in action, try adding extra lines of code that call the function with different arguments in the code editor, like the following:\n\n```python\nadd_one(155)\nadd_one(5)\nadd_one(-1)\n```\n\n<CodeEditor>\ndef add_one(x):\n  print(x + 1) \n</CodeEditor>\n\nDo you notice how the function printed the sum of each of these numbers plus one? Writing this function helped us to automate this simple process of addition for each given input! Granted, creating a whole function just to add \"one\" to something may seem unnecessarily complicated, but once you have learned the basics of function-writing, the possibilities are powerful and limitless!\n\n### Advanced\nNote that writing a function this way only prints the result, but does not actually `return` it. Read more about the difference between `print` and `return` [here](https://pythonprinciples.com/blog/print-vs-return/). If we wanted our function to actually perform the operation AND print it, we could revise our code as follows:\n\n```python\ndef add_one(x):\n  return x + 1\n\nprint(add_one(2))\n```\n\n## Writing your second function\n\nOur functions do not have to be \"mathematical\" in nature. Let's say that I wanted to say a friendly hello, but didn't want to type out a long sentence every time I wanted to do so. We could automate this process with a function. In the code editor below, write the following lines:\n\n- `def greet():`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"Hello! How are you today?\")`  \n\n`greet()`\n\n<CodeEditor snippets='mobydick.txt, aesop.txt'></CodeEditor>\n\nFirst we define our `greet()` function, and add a line to print to the screen. Lastly, we call the function so it will run. You might have noticed that this time, we didn't pass in an argument! Note that a function doesn't have to take an input (or argument), or it can take several arguments! There is a lot of flexibility involved in writing your own functions, which you can craft carefully to do exactly what you want them to! Read more about some of the many things you can do with functions on the online web tutorial [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp).\n\n## Challenge\n\nHow could we change our greeting function to say hello to a specific person? Hint: your print statement will need to use string interpolation. We did this in \"3. Variables\" when we assigned y to \"hello\" `y = \"hello\"`, and then added `y + \" and goodbye\"`, which yielded the result `\"hello and goodbye\"`.\n\n<EditorWithTabs>\n</EditorWithTabs>\n\n## Solution\n\n<CodeEditor>\ndef greet(person):\n  print(\"Hello \" + person + \"! How are you today?\")\ngreet(\"Sarah\")\n</CodeEditor>\n\nAs you can see, the result of calling this function prints `\"Hello Sarah! How are you today?\"`\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich of the following are not true about a function?:\n\n<Quiz>\n- A function can be reused\n- A function can take any number of arguments (including no arguments)\n- A function needs to be called in order to run\n- A function can only perform mathematical operations*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n- [argument](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\n- [parameter](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) \n- [function](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/function.md)\n\n# Lists\n\nRemember lists? They look like this:\n\n```python\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n```\n\nLet's create a list together and print it out. In the code editor below, write the following lines:\n\n- `books = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']`\n- `print(books)`\n\n<CodeEditor></CodeEditor>\n\nYou should see the list printed out in the output.\n\nSo far, we've only learned one function: `type()`. Let's try out another, called `len()`, which returns the number of items in a list or the number of characters in a string. \n\nTake a look at the code provided for you in the editor below:\n\n<CodeEditor>\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n# print(books)\nlist_length = len(books)\nprint(list_length)\n</CodeEditor>\n\nFirst, we have our list of books from before. Next, we \"comment out\" the `print(books)` statement with the hashtag `#`, which tells Python to _ignore_ that line of code. Comments are not read by the interpreter and are only for us humans. \n\nNext, let's break down this unfamiliar line of code: `list_length = len(books)`\n\n- __First__, we have saved a list of books to the variable, `books`.\n- __Second__, `list_length = len(book)` takes the `books` variable from the previous line as an *argument* (or input data) for the `len()` function. That's why `books` is within the parentheses. This syntax means that Python will run the `len()` function on the items in `books`. Then, it sets the result of that process to a new variable, called `list_length`.\n- __Finally__, we print the `list_length` value.\n\nThis might appear a bit complex at first, but if you read the line slowly you should be able to connect the dots.\n\nNotice that when you run the code above, you don't see the `books` list printed out. That's because that line has become a comment. If you put a `#` (hash or pound) at the beginning of a line, that line will be ignored.\n\n## List Indexing\n\nA useful property of a list is the list index. This allows you to pick out an item from within the list by a number starting from zero:\n\nFor instance, add the following lines of code to the program below:\n\n- `print(books[0]) # Gender Trouble`\n- `print(books[1]) # Cruising Utopia`\n\n<CodeEditor>\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']`\nprint(books)\n</CodeEditor>\n\nIndexing lets us get at individual items from a particular list. Note that the first item in the list is `item[0]`. The second item is `item[1]`. That's because counting in Python, and in almost all programming languages, starts from `0`.\n\nAdditionally, you can print out the last item in a list using negative numbers, where `-1` denotes the last item in the list. For instance, if you were to add:\n\n- `print(books[-1]) # Living a Feminist Life`\n\nto the books program, it would print the last item in the books list. `-2` would print the second to last item, `-3` the third to last, and so on.\n\n## Slicing Lists\n\nThere are many things you can do with list indexing, like _slicing_. Slicing consists of taking a section of a list, using the list index to pick out a range of list items. For example, you could take out the first _two_ items of a list with a slice that begins with `0` and ends with `2`.\n\nThe slice syntax consists of square brackets, start point and end point, and a colon to indicate the gap in between. This should print out the first two items of your list.  Go ahead and add the following line to the code below to see slicing in action:\n\n- `print(books[0:2])`\n\n<CodeEditor>\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n</CodeEditor>\n\nNote a couple of things. First, the start point is *inclusive*, meaning that Python will include the `[0]` item in your range, and the end point is _exclusive_, so Python won't print the `[2]` item. Instead, it will print everything up until that `[2]` item.\n\nFor ultimate brevity, you can also write this expression as:\n\n```python\nprint(books[:2])\n```\n\nThe empty value before the colon allows Python to assume the range starts at the first list item, at `[0]`. You can also end the slice with `:`, if you want the list range to include all subsequent items until the end of the list. \n\nThe example below will print everything from the second item to the end of the list.\n\n```python\nprint(books[1:])\n```\n\nWith a list that contains three items total, list slicing might not seem very impressive right now. However, this will become a powerful tool once we get to more sophisticated text analysis and start to encounter lists that contain hundreds (or thousands!) of items.\n\n## Challenge\n\nIn the REPL below, create a new list of books with at least 5 books in your list. Make sure the total number of books in the list is an **odd** number. How do you get python to print out the book in the middle of the list? What about the three books in the middle? Remember that the first value in a slice is _inclusive_, and the final value is _exclusive_.\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\n## Solution\n\n```pycon\n>>> books = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life', 'Radiant Textuality', 'The Undercommons']\n\n>>> books[2] # ['Living a Feminist Life']\n\n>>> books[1:4] # ['Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life', 'Radiant Textuality']\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nHow would you get Python to print the length of the last book in the list? Hint: this number reflects the length of the _string_ which is the last item in the list. Choose the correct expression from the options below.\n\n<Quiz>\n- `len(books)`\n- `print(books[-1])`\n- `print(len[-1])`\n- `print(len(books[-1]))`*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [list](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/list.md)\n- [list indexing](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/list_indexing.md)\n- [len()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/len.md)\n\n# Loops\n\nWhat if we want to print out each item in the list separately? For that, we'll need something called a _loop_.\n\nAdd the following lines of code to the editor below:\n\n- `for book in books:`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"My favorite book is \" + book)`\n\n<CodeEditor>\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n</CodeEditor>\n\nWhat's happening here? This kind of loop is called a \"for loop\", and tells Python: \"for each item in the list, do something.\" Let's break it down:\n\n```python\nfor <variable name> in <list name>:\n    <do something>\n```\n\nIndented code like this is known as a \"code block.\" Python will run the `<do something>` code in the code block once for each item in the list. You can also refer to `<variable name>` in the `<do something>` block.\n\nYou can also loop through items within a string. Type the following code into the editor below:\n\n- `for letter in \"hello\":`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(letter)`\n\n<CodeEditor></CodeEditor>\n\nThe result should print out each letter of the string `hello`, one by one.\n\n## A Note on Variable Names\n\nIn this section, we've discussed books in the context of a list. Why do we use the variable name `books` in this section for our list of book names? Why not just use the variable name `x`, or perhaps `f`?\n\nWhile the computer might not care if our list of books is called `x`, giving variables meaningful names makes a program considerably easier to read than it would be otherwise. Consider this for loop:\n\n```python\ny = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n\nfor x in y:\n    print(x)\n```\n\nWhich is easier to read, this for loop or the one used in the previous example?\n\nWhen variable names accurately reflect what they represent, and are therefore meaningful, we call them _semantic_.  Always try to create semantic variable names whenever possible.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. Here's a list of numbers:\n\n<CodeEditor>\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n</CodeEditor>\n\nWrite some code to print out the square of each of these numbers. Remember that the square of a number is that number times itself. The solution is below, but you're not allowed to look at it until you've tried to solve it yourself for 3.5 minutes. (Seriously! That's 210 seconds.)\n\n2. Look up a new concept—\"f-string\" (a formatting technique for strings)—on Google and, using the code editor above, use it to write a loop that gives the following output:\n\n```pycon\nThe square of 2 is 4.\nThe square of 3 is 9.\nThe square of 5 is 25.\nThe square of 7 is 49.\nThe square of 11 is 121.\n```\n\n__Note:__ the \"f-string\" is a new string formatting method for Python 3. You can [read more about this new string formatting method](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#f-strings-a-new-and-improved-way-to-format-strings-in-python).\n\n## Solution\n\n1. To get the square of the elements in the list `prime_numbers`, you can:\n\n```python\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n\nfor num in prime_numbers:\n    print(num * num)\n```\n\n2. Using \"f-strings\" to output the list of results in the challenge would look something like this:\n\n```python\nprime_numbers= [2,3,5,7,11]\nfor num in prime_numbers:\n    print(f\"The square of {num} is {num * num}\")\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat are different ways for describing what a \"for loop\" can do?\n\n<Quiz>\n- for each item in a list, multiply it against itself.*\n- print the contents of a list.*\n- add a new item to a list.\n- loop through characters in a string.\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [for loop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/for_loop.md)\n- [f-string](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/f-string.md)\n\n# Conditionals\n\nConditionals allow programs to change their behavior based on whether some statement is true or false. Let's try this out by writing a script that will give different outputs (consisting of book titles) based on the specified field of study. Type the following into the code editor below:\n\n- `field = \"Media Studies\"`\n\n- `if field == \"Media Studies\":`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")`\n- `else:`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")`\n\n<CodeEditor></CodeEditor>\n\nIn our first line, we set a variable `field` to the string `\"Media Studies\"`, representing our chosen field of study. The `if` statement checks whether the field is set to the string \"Media Studies\". If it is, the code in the block beneath is executed, so the string `\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\"` will be printed.\n\nIt's important to note at this point the use of the double equals sign `==` in `if` statements. The double equals is an _equality_ operator, and it checks to see if the two values on either side are equivalent. Contrast this with the single equals that you've already seen, `=`, which is an _assignment_ operator, that assigns a value to a variable. In the line `field = \"Media Studies\"`, you are using the assignment operator `=` to set the variable's value to \"Media Studies\", (a string) while in the `if` statement, you're using the equality operator `==` to check if the field is equivalent to \"Media Studies\".\n\nYou'll also notice the inclusion of a new line, the `else` statement. The `else` statement handles any inputs that aren't \"Media Studies\", and the program merely prints out that it doesn't know what you should bring. You can think of `else` like a fail-safe that catches variables not directly accounted for.\n\nTry this script out both with the variable set to \"Media studies\" and the variable set to some other value, representing another field of study.\n\nWhat if we want our program to handle more fields of study, giving different messages for each one? Other cases after the first `if` statement are handled with `elif`, which is a shortened version of `else if`. Add the following code into the editor below:\n\n- `if field == \"Media Studies\":`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")`\n- `elif field == \"Critical University Studies\":`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"The Undercommons\")`\n- `elif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"Radiant Textuality\")`\n- `else:`\n- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")`\n\n<CodeEditor>\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\n</CodeEditor>\n\nNow, if you were to change the `field` variable, you could run other blocks of code. You can add as many `elif` statements as you need, meaning that conditionals in Python have one `if` statement, any number of `elif` statements, and one `else` statement that catches any input not covered by `if` or `elif`. Over the next sections, we'll work on improving this little application, making it able to handle user input directly.\n\n## Challenge\n\nAdd two more `elif` statements to the program to make it better able to handle different potential fields of study. Change the field of study a couple of times, making sure to save after each change, to test out your code.\n\n<CodeEditor>\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n</CodeEditor>\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\n\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelif field == \"Critical Race Studies\"\n    print(\"The New Jim Crow\")\nelif field == \"DH Methodologies\"\n    print(\"Algorithmic Criticism\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat is the difference between the double equals (`==`) and single equals (`=`)?\n\n<Quiz>\n- The double equals checks to see if one value is equivalent to the other, as in `2 == 2`.*\n- The double equals assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left, as in `x == 2`.\n- The single equals checks to see if one value is equivalent to the other, as in `2 = 2`.\n- The single equals assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left, as in `x = 2`.*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [if-Statement](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/if_statement.md)\n\n# Input\n\n**Note:** If you're using your terminal and text editor to get through the workshop (instead of the built-in emulator in the browser) and are using Python 2.7, replace all `input()` functions in the code below with `raw_input()`. You can check your version by running `python --version` in the command line.\n\n## Taking Input\n\nPython allows you to take input directly from the user using the `input()` function.\n\nLet's try it out by setting the function to a variable, which we will call `greeting`. In the REPL below, write the following line of code:\n\n- `>>> greeting = input()`\n\nWhen you press <kbd>enter</kbd>, you should see a pop-up asking for input. Type in your favorite greeting. I'm going to type `hey you!`. Then, press <kbd>enter</kbd>. \n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\nNext, write `greeting` into the REPL. You should see something like the following appear:\n\n```pycon\n>>> greeting = input()\ngreeting\nhey you!\n```\n\nPython has saved your input text to the variable `greeting`. When you type in `greeting`, it will print out that input text. Pretty nifty, right?\n\n```pycon\n>>> greeting = input()\nhey you!\n\n>>> greeting\n'hey you!'\n```\n\nYou can play around with `input()` by adding some prompt text within the parenthesis. Whatever you put inside the parenthesis, enclosed by quotes, will prompt the user to type in their text, which is then assigned to the variable set to `input()`. Sounds complicated, so give it some practice with the REPL. \n\nFor instance, if we were to type the following:\n\n- `>>> feelings = input('How are you feeling today? ')`\n\nWe can answer with `like a rollercoaster of emotions`. Then, when we type in our variable `feelings` and press enter, we'll get our input printed back at us. Note that there's a little space after the question mark and before the closing quotation mark, which is to improve readability.\n\n```pycon\n>>> feelings = input('How are you feeling today? ')\nHow are you feeling today? like a rollercoaster of emotions\n\n>>> feelings\n'like a rollercoaster of emotions'\n```\n\n## Challenge\n\nRemember this loop?\n\n<CodeEditor>\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n</CodeEditor>\n\nNow, that we understand a bit about how `input()` works, let's use it to improve our book application. We are going to use `input()` to ask for the field before displaying the output. To do this, add one more line of code in the editor above that sets the `field` variable to an `input()`. Make sure you include a little prompt that asks the user what book they want to select or read that day.\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nfield = input(\"Which field of study do you want to read about today? \")\n\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIf we wanted to calculate the length of an input using `len()`, how would we write that expression?\n\n<Quiz>\n- `input() = len()`\n- `response = len().input()`\n- `len(input()) = length_of_response`\n- `length_of_response = len(input())`*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [input()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/input.md)\n\n# Doing Things to Lists\n\nOkay. Let's make our little book application a little more robust. We are going to create a list of books (remember lists?) that we can then manipulate in all sorts of ways.\n\nFirst, create a new list in the code editor with at least three books that are important to your research right now. Shorten the titles to one or two words if need be. Let's call this list our `library`. Remember the proper syntax for creating a list includes square brackets with commas separating the list items. Because the items are strings, they should also be inside quotes. For instance, your code might look something like:\n\n- `library = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]`\n\n<CodeEditor></CodeEditor>\n\nNext, let's sort our `library` in alphabetical order. There's a handy method called `sort()` for doing just this kind of thing. What's a _method_, you might ask? Well, _methods_ are very similar to _functions_, and you'll remember that functions are ways of doing things, like `print()` and `type()`. Methods are also ways of doing things, but these things are attached to what we call _objects_ in Python. Objects are part of object-oriented-programming, and that's definitely not necessary to learn right now. Suffice it to say that methods are just like functions, that is, they are ways of doing things to your data.\n\nTo sort the list, use the `sort()` method on your list that you created above. Your code should look like this:\n\n```pycon\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nlibrary.sort()\nprint(library)\n```\nWhat happened here? Let's take it line by line. First, we created a list `library` with three items attached to it. Then, we applied the `sort()` method to the library list. Finally, we printed the `library`, which is now sorted in alphabetical order.\n\nYou'll see that we have a couple of new things happening with symbols.\n- First, the period `.` which is an _operator_ in Python. The period operator is another part of object-oriented-programming, and it basically means that we are applying a task to whatever precedes the period. In this case, we are applying the `sort()` method to our `library` list. It's kind of like attaching a function to our `library`.\n- Second, we have the parenthesis `()` after `sort`. When you get more comfortable with programming, you'll often use the parentheses to include what we call _arguments_ that allows us to do more complex things to data. Let's see how an argument works with the `append()` method.\n\nWhat if we want to add items to the list? We can use the `append()` method for that. For instance, try the following:\n\n<CodeEditor>\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nlibrary.append(\"La Frontera\")\nprint(library)\n</CodeEditor>\n\nYou can see that we have added `\"La Frontera\"` as an argument to the `append()` method by putting the string between the parenthesis. It basically means that we will be appending this specific title to the library list.\n\nWhen you print `library`, you should see your new book appear at the end of the list. Pretty cool, right? Go ahead and add a couple more books to your list.\n\nWhat if you wanted to take out some of the books? We can use `pop()` to remove the last item, or \"pop\" it off, from our list.\n\n<CodeEditor>\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\", \"La Frontera\", \"Dawn\"]\nlibrary.pop()\nprint(library)\n</CodeEditor>\n\nThe last item that you added to your list should be missing from the `library` when you print the list.\n\n## Challenge\n\nRemember the `input()` function from the last lesson? This challenge uses that function in combination with what you know about list methods to create a little library app. You will play around with the input button, asking the user what kinds of things they want to do with their library, and writing some code that does those things and prints out the results.\n\nFirst, create a new file called `library.py`. Save it to your current working folder.\n\nSecond, create a list of `library` books, with at least three books (you can use the same ones as before).\n\n```python\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\n```\n\nThen, add an input statement that will save the user's response to a variable, like `response`.\n\n```python\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\n```\n\nNow, create a conditional statement that matches the user's response to series of options for doing things to the `library` list. We'll let them sort the library (`sort()`), add new items (`append()`), and remove the last item (`pop()`). I'll do the first one, `sort()`, for you:\n\n<CodeEditor>\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\nif response == \"sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n</CodeEditor>\n\nSee how the order of statements build on each other toward the final product? First, we create a library of books. Then, we set the user's response about what to do with those books. Then, we create a conditional statement that matches the response to specific tasks. The first condition checks to see if the user wants to \"sort\" the books, then sorts them, then prints the final result.\n\nNext, add `pop()` and `append()` to the program. \n\nAfter adding a few more conditions, test out your code! You should have a little library app that sorts, adds, and removes books from your list.\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\nif response == \"sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"add\":\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"remove\":\n    library.pop()\n    print(library)\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSelect the following statements that truly describe `sort()`, `append()`, and `pop()`.\n\n<Quiz>\n- methods are like functions which are attached to objects.*\n- `sort()`, `append()`, and `pop()` are functions.\n- `append()` always takes an argument.*\n- `pop()` can be applied to a string.\n</Quiz>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n__Advanced question:__ If you `sort()` the library in between adding and popping a book, you'll end up with a different list than if you didn't run `sort()` in between `append()` and `pop()`. Can you guess why?\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [append](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/append.md)\n- [sort()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/sort.md)\n- [pop()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/pop.md)\n\n# Finding Answers with Google\n\nOur library app is working pretty well, but you may have noticed that it's case sensitive:\n\n```\nWhat do you want to do with your books today?\nSort\nI don't know what you want me to do!\n```\n\nHow could we fix our program to handle cases like this? We could add a bunch of new `elif` statements, like this:\n\n```python\n...\nelif response == \"Sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"SORT\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\n...\n```\n\nBut this is a lot of work, and it's a pretty ugly solution. If we wanted to add more cases to our program, we would have to write them in twice every time, and it still wouldn't fix inputs like `SorT`. The best way to improve our program would be to convert the input to lower case before we send it to our `if/else` block.\n\nEven if you're a super rad Python programmer, you're not going to remember every function name or how to do things you might not have touched in awhile. One thing programmers get very good at is googling for answers. In fact, this is arguably the most important skill in modern-day programming. So, let's use Google to find out how to convert strings to lower case.\n\nLet's try the search term [make string lowercase](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=make+string+lowercase+Python):\n\n![make string lower case Python Google search](/images/python/google_search.png)\n\nWhile Google searches change over time, some of your results likely come from a site called Stack Overflow. This is a questions and answers site for programmers that usually has strong answers to questions about Python.\n\n![Google search results with stack overflow answer on top](/images/python/google_result.png)\n\nOn [this _Stack Overflow_ page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-do-i-lowercase-a-string-in-python), take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. Then scroll down to the answers to find what we're looking for. You may also notice snarky debates—another \"feature\" of _Stack Overflow_.\n\n## Implementing Our Answer\n\nAccording to this answer, we can make a string lowercase by adding `.lower()` to the end of it, like this:\n\n```pycon\n>>> \"SORT\".lower()\n'sort'\n```\n\nLet's incorporate this transformation into our library app:\n\n<CodeEditor>\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\nresponse = response.lower()\nif response == \"sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"add\":\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"remove\":\n    library.pop()\n    print(library)\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n</CodeEditor>\n\nThis new script should handle any combination of upper or lowercase characters. The new second line sets the response variable to a new value, `response.lower()`, which is a lowercase version of the original input.\n\nThere's no shame in googling for answers! Error messages are especially useful to google when you run into them. Keep an eye out for _Stack Overflow_ answers, as they tend to have useful examples. The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) will also frequently come up, but I would recommend avoiding it as a resource until you have more programming experience. It's a great resource, but the way information is presented can be confusing until you get the hang of reading documentation.\n\nBefore moving on to the next section, complete the first challenge below. This challenge will teach the skills necessary to complete write more advanced scripts in this workshop.\n\n## Challenge\n\n__Note:__ the first challenge is \"required\" in order to complete further sections.\n\n1. We are going to use `while` loops to get Python to repeat loops over and over again. This involves adding a `while` statement to your library app. The code should look like this, and it goes right after the `library` list and before your `input` statement.\n\n    ```python\n    while True:\n        ...\n    ```\n\n    Make sure that everything under `while True:` is indented (this creates a \"code block,\" or a group of lines that will be executed together)\n\n    TODO: fix up the wording below\n    To stop the loop, you can press <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> in the terminal. This stops the program from being run, what we call \"interrupting\" the program. You can also add a `break` statement somewhere in your code which will automatically exit the program. For example:\n\n    ```python\n        if response == \"sort\":\n            library.sort()\n            print(library)\n            break\n        ...\n        else:\n            print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n    ```\n\n    Try adding the `while` loop to the program below:\n\n\n<CodeEditor>\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\nresponse = response.lower()\nif response == \"sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"add\":\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"remove\":\n    library.pop()\n    print(library)\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n</CodeEditor>\n\nOnce you get the loop to work, you can add more `elif` statements to add more books to the list. Then, run the program, adding books, sorting them and removing them. You can read more about `while` loops [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp).\n\n2. (optional) OK, I told you not to look at the Python documentation. But doesn't that make you really want to go look at the Python documentation? How bad could this \"documentation\" really be? What terrible secrets might it hold?\n\n    Fine. Have a look at the [Python documentation on built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Here's how you would include a `while` statement in our library application:\n\n    ```python\n    library = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\n    while True:\n        response = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\n        response = response.lower()\n        if response == \"sort\":\n            library.sort()\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"add\":\n            library.append(\"La Frontera\")\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"add again\":\n            library.append(\"In the Dreamhouse\")\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"more books\":\n            library.append(\"Giovanni's Room\")\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"moar\":\n            library.append(\"Nightwood\")\n            print(library)\n            break\n        elif response == \"remove\":\n            library.pop()\n            print(library)\n        else:\n            print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIf we wanted to make a string like `'hello'` uppercase, we would use the method `upper()`, in the following way:\n\n<Quiz>\n- `upper('hello')`\n- `upper().'hello'`\n- `'hello'.upper()`*\n- `'hello'(upper)`\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [lower()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/lower.md)\n- [Method](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/method.md)\n\n# A Little Motivation\n\nEarly on, we learned a bit about lists, which look like this:\n\n```python\n[\"Gender Trouble\", \"Cruising Utopia\", \"Living a Feminist Life\"]\n```\n\nWe're going to create a small application that will print a random motivational saying every time a user presses <kbd>enter</kbd>. Our first step will be to create a list of positive sayings:\n\n```python\nmotivational_phrases = [\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n    ]\n```\n\nYou're still using the same list format. Remember lists open with a square bracket `[`, have items separated with commas, and end with a square bracket `]`, like this:\n\n```python\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nHowever, our positivity list above spreads the list out over multiple lines for greater readability, which is allowed in Python. Remember that you can change the strings in the list to whatever phrases you choose.\n\n## Importing a module\n\nNow that we have our sayings, let's use it in conjunction with some functionality from a module that's built into Python: the `random` module.\n\nFirst we need to __import__ the module.  In the code editor below, write the following line of code _above_ our motivational phrases...\n\n`import random`\n\n...and the following line of code _below_ our motivational phrases:\n\n`print(random.choice(motivational_phrases))`\n\n<CodeEditor>\nmotivational_phrases = [\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n    ]\n</CodeEditor>\n\nNow, each time you run the code, you should see a different motivational phrase as output. The `random.choice` function chooses a random item from a list and returns it. The `.` syntax indicates that the function is coming from the `random` library.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. As with our library app, this positive saying generator could be improved by making it so the program doesn't have to run again every time to get new output. Add a while loop for the final version. Remember to include a `break` statement or another way for the loop to end (so you are not creating an infinite loop). You can read more [about while loops here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp).\n\n2. The real point of this section is to learn `import`, which is where Python really starts to get interesting. Python comes with many libraries (importable collections of code), written by others that can be pulled into your program, allowing you to use that functionality. In this challenge, do a little research on Python libraries that might solve a problem for you or address a domain that you're interested in.\n\nThink of something you're interested in doing (statistics, text analysis, web scraping, quantitative analysis, processing Excel/PDF/image files) and search google \"<_thing you are interested in_> python library\". You're almost certain to find some useful results. For example, if you wanted to find Python libraries for dealing with cleaning up HTML files, you might search one of these:\n\n> working with html python library\n\n> html parser python library\n\nIn your research, you may also want to look at the libraries that come with Python. You can find a list of libraries in these libraries [here](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Here's how you could add a `while` loop to our positive saying generator:\n\n<CodeEditor>\nimport random\nwhile True:\n    motivational_phrases = [\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n        ]\n    # Because this is input, the user will need to hit enter to see a new phrase\n    input(random.choice(motivational_phrases))\n</CodeEditor>\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat is a module? Select all that apply:\n\n<Quiz>\n- A module is a file of code.*\n- Applications can incorporate many different modules.*\n- A module needs to be downloaded and installed.\n- A module needs to be imported with an `import` statement.*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Modules](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/module.md)\n- [Random](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/random.md)\n- [while loops](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/while_loop.md)\n\n# Objects in Python\n\nObjects in Python (and other programming languages) are basically containers that can hold data and/or functions inside them. When a function is inside an object, we usually call the function a \"method.\" When data is inside an object, we usually call it an \"attribute.\" The terminology isn't that important, though. What we do need to know is that you can access these \"methods\" and \"attributes\" with a `.` (a dot or period).\n\nWhen we added `sort()`, `append()`, `pop()`, and `lower()` to our library app, we briefly saw how some methods contained inside certain objects in Python, like Lists (for sort, append, and pop), and String objects, like lower.\n\n```pycon\n>>> loud_greeting = \"HELLO!\"\n\n>>> loud_greeting.lower()\n'hello!'\n```\n\nMany, or most, objects in Python have methods that allow you to use them in different ways. As you move into using more advanced Python, you'll find that understanding what methods are available becomes more important.\n\n## Examining Objects\n\nWhen you encounter an object, how can you learn its methods and attributes so you can use them? There are two main ways. The first, and likely the most practical, is to read the documentation of the library you're using.\n\nHowever, you can also use the `dir()` function, which will tell you which methods and attributes are available in an object.\n\nLet's use the REPL for a moment. First, type the following line:\n\n`>>> s = 'Hello, world!'`\n\nThen, use the `dir()` function on `s`:\n\n`>>> dir(s)`\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\nYou should get output like this:\n\n```pycon\n['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__',\n...\n'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']\n```\n\nThe above output shows some of the methods and attributes for Python strings that can be accessed using the dot (`.`) syntax. Also, be aware that Python doesn't print all the possible methods and attributes, just what it considers to be most important. Also, when using `dir()`, you'll mostly want to ignore the methods and attributes that have underscores around them. They mainly have to do with the internals of the Python language. For now, ignore the information within underscores (like `__add__`) and focus on the stuff surrouned by single quotes (like `startswith`).\n\nYou can also use `dir()` to see what functions are available from Python libraries that you import. Try importing the `random` library again and see what you get when you enter `dir(random)` in the REPL.\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\nYou should see something like this:\n\n```pycon\n>>> import random\n\n>>> dir(random)\n['BPF', 'LOG4', 'NV_MAGICCONST', 'RECIP_BPF', 'Random', 'SG_MAGICCONST', 'SystemRandom', 'TWOPI', '_BuiltinMethodType', '_MethodType', '_Sequence', '_Set', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', '_acos', '_bisect', '_ceil', '_cos', '_e', '_exp', '_inst', '_itertools', '_log', '_os', '_pi', '_random', '_sha512', '_sin', '_sqrt', '_test', '_test_generator', '_urandom', '_warn', 'betavariate', 'choice', 'choices', 'expovariate', 'gammavariate', 'gauss', 'getrandbits', 'getstate', 'lognormvariate', 'normalvariate', 'paretovariate', 'randint', 'random', 'randrange', 'sample', 'seed', 'setstate', 'shuffle', 'triangular', 'uniform', 'vonmisesvariate', 'weibullvariate']\n```\n\nTry entering other objects based on Python types we've already learned to the `dir()` function. For example, you might try `dir([1, 2, 3])` to see what methods are available when using lists.\n\n## Challenge\n\n*Advanced Final Challenge*:\n\nIn this final challenge, we will work more with modules and imports. Let's work through a basic example using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, which allows us to perform various kinds of textual analysis. This will be a fairly introductory example, so if you would like to learn more about NLTK and text analysis you can [visit our workshop devoted entirely to it!](https://szweibel.github.io/DHRI-static/workshops/text-analysis/)\n\nTake a look at the following code:\n\n<CodeEditor>\nimport nltk\nnltk.download(\"book\")\nfrom nltk.book import *\ntext1\n</CodeEditor>\n\nFirst, we `import` the NLTK library into our program:\n\n","title":"Newthon","excerpt":"Python is a general-purpose programming language suitable for a wide variety of tasks in the digital humanities.

This means we will be using Python in the terminal, which is a special space that allows us to run little bits of Python, experimenting and exploring what it can do, without having to save it. Think of this interactive space as a playground. Later on, we will be working with Python in a more robust way, doing what we call saving and executing Python scripts.\n\nFor now, though, let's start an interactive session with Python, which is accessed through the terminal.\n\nOpen your terminal and type:\n\n```console\n$ python\n```\n\nat the prompt. You should see something like this\n\n```pycon\nPython 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34)\n[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>>\n```\n\nUnlike the normal `$` terminal prompt (or `%` if you are on MacOS), the Python prompt looks like this:\n\n```pycon\n>>>\n```\n\nThese greater-than symbols `>` are how you know that you have entered an interactive session with Python. Now you are interacting directly with Python, rather than in the regular terminal. Keep an eye on these greater-than symbols, as a common early source of confusion is entering terminal commands into the Python prompt or entering Python commands into the terminal.\n\n## A Little Math\n\nLet's try a little math at the Python prompt. In the example below, type the text that appears after the Python prompt (the `>>>`). The line below is the output that is returned. This will be a standard convention when giving examples using the Python prompt.\n\n```pycon\n>>> 2 + 3\n5\n\n>>> 14 - 10\n4\n\n>>> 10 * 10\n100\n\n>>> 6 / 3\n2\n\n>>> 21 % 4\n1\n```\n\nThe first four operations above are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. The last operation is modulo, or mod, which returns the remainder after division.\n\nNote the way you interact with Python at the prompt. After entering an expression such as `2 + 3`, Python \"evaluates\" it to a simpler form, `5`, and then prints out the answer for you. **This process is called the Read Eval Print Loop, or REPL**. Reading takes commands from you, the input is evaluated or run, the result is printed out, and the prompt is shown again to wait for more input. The normal terminal (the one with the `$`) is another example of a REPL.\n\nThe REPL is useful for quick tests and, later, can be used for exploring and debugging your programs interactively. You might consider it a kind of playground for testing and experimenting with python expressions.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. For a few minutes, practice moving in and out of Python's interactive mode (aka the REPL). You can get out of Python by hitting <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> (or <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> or <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> if you're on a computer running Windows) or by typing `exit()`. You can get back in the REPL by typing `python` at the `$` prompt. Remember that you're in the REPL when you see `>>>`, and you're in bash or your terminal when you see the `$`.\n\n2. One \"operator\" (math symbol) we didn't learn is the exponent—you know, \"x raised to the power of...\" If you were Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, how would you define this operator?\n\n## Solution\n\n2. The exponent operator is two asterisks (`**`). For example, the number `3` to the power of `2` would be expressed as `3**2`.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat are the characteristics of the REPL? Select all that apply.\n<Quiz>\n- The REPL has a prompt that begins with `$`.\n- The REPL has a prompt that begins with `>>>`.*\n- The REPL and the terminal are the same thing.\n- The REPL can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions like `2 + 2`.*\n</Quiz>\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [REPL](/terms/repl.md)\n\n# Types\n\nTypes are classifications that let the computer know how a programmer intends to use a piece of data. You can just think of them as, well, types of data.\n\nWe've already seen one type in the last section: the integer. In this section, we'll learn four more: the floating point number, the string, the boolean, and the list.\n\nEnter these lines as you see them below:\n\n```pycon\n>>> type(1)\n<class 'int'>\n\n>>> type(1.0)\n<class 'float'>\n\n>>> type(\"Hello there!\")\n<class 'str'>\n\n>>> type(True)\n<class 'bool'>\n\n>>> type([1, 2, 3])\n<class 'list'>\n```\n\nEach of the responses show how the different types of data registers as different \"types\" for Python:\n\n**Integers** (like `1` above) are whole numbers.\n\n**Floats** (like `1.0` above) are numbers with decimals, and are treated a little differently than integers.\n\n**Strings** (like `\"Hello there!\"` above) are arbitrary sets of characters, such as letters and numbers. You can think of them as a way to store text.\n\n**Booleans**: (like `True` above) is a fancy term for values representing \"true\" and \"false,\" or \"truthiness\" and \"falsiness.\" In Python they are always capitalized: `True` and `False`.\n\n**Lists**: (like `[1, 2, 3]` above) are ordered collections of values. You can put any of the other types in a list: `[\"hello\", \"goodbye\", \"see ya later\"]` is also a valid list.\n\nDon't worry about trying to actively remember these types. We'll be working with each in turn in the following sections.\n\n<PythonREPL/>\n\n## What's the deal with type()?\n\n`type()` is a function. You can think of functions in Python in a few different ways:\n\n1. A way of doing something in Python.\n2. A way of saving some code for reuse.\n3. A way of taking an input, transforming that input, and returning an output. The input goes in the parentheses `()`.\n\nThese are all valid ways of thinking about functions. We'll be learning more about functions in later sections.\n\n## Challenge\n\nOpen your web browser, and google the phrase \"python function.\" Skim through the first few results. What words do you recognize, and which ones look unfamiliar? What do you think the unfamiliar ones mean? Try to rephrase some of this new language, and guess what they mean in your own words.\n\n## Solution\n\nWhen you google \"python function,\" you may see some phrases that look unfamiliar, like \"return value\" or \"pass parameters.\" These are advanced terms for inputting and outputting data from a function. It's important to become familiar with the Python's terminology about functions, as it will be helpful later on when you start working with these components.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSelect all the following that accurately describe the data type categories.\n\n- Booleans represent only `True` or `False` values.*\n- Integers can be expressed with numbers like `1` or letters `one`.\n- Strings can contain numbers within quotations, like `\"1\"`.*\n- Lists can contain strings, like `['banana, 'coffee', 'eggs']`.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Function](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/function.md)\n- [Boolean](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/boolean.md)\n- [Float](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/float.md)\n- [Integer](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/integer.md)\n- [String](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/string.md)\n- [List](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/list.md)\n- [Type()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/type.md)\n\n# Variables\n\nA variable is **a symbol that refers to an object**, such as a string, integer, or list. If you're not already at the Python prompt, open your terminal and type `python` at the `$`. You're in the right place when you see `>>>`.\n\nTry these commands in order:\n\n```pycon\n>>> x = 5\n\n>>> x\n5\n\n>>> x + 10\n15\n\n>>> y = \"hello\"\n\n>>> y\n'hello'\n\n>>> y + \" and goodbye\"\n'hello and goodbye'\n```\n\nAs you can see from the examples above, the `=` sign lets you assign symbols like `x` and `y` to data.\n\nVariables can be longer words as well, and they can be set to lists:\n\n```pycon\n>>> books = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia','Living a Feminist Life']\n\n>>> books\n['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n\n>>> type(books)\n<class 'list'>\n```\n\nVariables can have letters, numbers, and underscores, **but should start with a letter**.\n\nIf you are curious about learning more about naming conventions for variables, you can check out the PEP8 style guide's section on [Naming Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions). PEP8 is the widely accepted guide for Python programmers everywhere.\n\n## Challenge\n\nSo I just told you that variables shouldn't start with a number or an underscore. What does that even mean? Will your computer explode if you write `1_book = \"Gender Trouble\"`?\n\nOnly one way to find out. Try giving weird names to variables and see if you can learn a bit about the rules.\n\n## Solution\n\nThere are a few rules regarding the way that you write the variable statement. This is because Python reads everything left to right, and needs things to be in a certain order.\n\nFirst, you cannot use any numbers or special characters to start a variable name. So `1_book`, `1book`, or any variable that contains special characters `@`, `#`, `$`, `$`, etc, wouldn't be acceptable in Python. You must start the variable with a letter and avoid using special characters.\n\nYou can incorporate numbers after you've started with a letter. So `book_1` or `b1` is acceptable, though you cannot use special characters at any point in the variable name.\n\nSecond, you might also notice that variable syntax requires you to write the variable name first, followed by an equal sign `=`, and then the value, or data. You cannot start the variable statement with the data value, because python always recognizes the first thing written as the thing to be assigned. The thing that comes after the `=` is the data that becomes attached to the preceding variable.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSelect all the variable expressions that are allowed in Python.\n\n- `1 = one`\n- `one = 1`*\n- `$$$ = \"dollar_signs\"`\n- `first_book = \"Orlando\"`*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Variables](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/variables.md)\n\n# Running Scripts\n\nSo far, you've interacted with Python one line at a time in the REPL. This is what we call the Interactive Mode, which is, as we mentioned, like a playground for experimenting and exploring different Python expressions, such `2 + 2` or `type(\"some stuff\")`. The code that we write in the REPL is not saved after you exit, which means that this space is for running Python expressions and *not* for writing longer programs.\n\nFor the rest of this session, we're going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with a text editor, where we write out Python scripts, and run those scripts from the terminal.\n\nThis is a big move, so let's take it slow. To reiterate, the major change is that we will be working across two spaces, the terminal and the text editor, rather than just the terminal alone. We will be writing our scripts into the text editor, and using the terminal to run those scripts.\n\n## Your First Script\n\nFirst, let's begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as Visual Studio Code) and create a new file with this line:\n\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\n```\n\nSave it with the name `hello.py` to a known location, such as your desktop. Open your terminal and move to the desktop directory:\n\n```console\n$ cd Desktop\n```\n\nOnce you're in the folder with your `hello.py` file, move to the terminal. Do *not* enter the Python Interactive Mode (the REPL), which is unnecessary to run python scripts. Instead, lookout for the `$` symbol that lets you know you're in the terminal. (If you find yourself in the Interactive mode (`>>>`), then try exiting it with <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>. You should see the `$` symbol, letting you know you're back in the terminal. If you still do not see the `$` symbol, type `exit()` followed by <kbd>enter</kbd> after the Python prompt, `>>>`.)\n\nNow that you're in the terminal, type the following, and press enter:\n\n```console\n$ python hello.py\nHello world!\n```\n\nYou should see the text `Hello world!` appear as output in the terminal window.\n\nCongratulations! You've written your first script. That's a big deal!\n\nThere are a couple of important things to note here:\n- First, it bears repeating that you are moving between two different spaces, the text editor and the terminal. You wrote your Python script in the text editor, and used the terminal to run the script.\n- Second, within in the text editor, you included the `print()` function because, unlike in the REPL, things aren't automatically printed out when writing scripts. When you're in the text editor, you always need to include the `print()` function so that your output will appear in the terminal.\n\n## A Note on Text\n\nFundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like Visual Studio Code or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There's nothing special about `.py` files—they're just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you can learn through the DHRI Curriculum—the command line, Git, markdown, grep—are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. Rewrite your program so that you assign the message to a variable, then print the variable. This will make your program two lines instead of one. There's a fancy programmer word for rewriting your code without changing its behavior—\"refactoring.\"\n\n2. (optional) Are you already getting sick of typing `python hello.py` again and again? Try typing `!!` in the command line (the `$`). This will run your last line of code again. Additionally, you can press the <kbd>up arrow</kbd> at the terminal prompt, and keep pressing it to scroll through the most recent commands.\n\n3. (even more optional) If you're on Windows and have a minute, try pressing the <kbd>windows</kbd> button on your keyboard and searching for a program called `IDLE` that comes with Python. It's a special editor (or IDE) that lets you run Python code from inside it. You might like it more than Git Bash.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. You should type the following into `hello.py`:\n\n    ```python\n    greeting = \"Hello World!\"\n    print(greeting)\n    ```\n\n    Then, making sure you're in the right directory, run `python hello.py` in the terminal `$`. You should see the following output:\n\n    ```console\n    $ python hello.py\n    Hello world!\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat are the differences between the terminal, REPL, and text editor? Select the correct statement from the below options.\n\n- You can run scripts from the **terminal** that were written on the text editor. *\n- The **REPL** allows you to save scripts for later use.\n- The **text editor** allows you to test code on the fly.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [REPL](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/repl.md)\n- [Scripts](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/scripts.md)\n- [print()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/print.md)\n\n# Errors in Python\n\nOur usual response when seeing an error on a computer screen is a stress response. Our heart rate elevates and, if we cannot do what we were asking the computer to do, our frustration mounts. This is because many errors when interacting with programs are not useful or informative, and because we often have no capability to fix the program in front of us.\n\nIn Python, errors are our friends. This might be hard to accept initially, but the errors you see when running Python scripts generally do a good job of pointing you to what's going wrong in your program. When you see an error in Python, therefore, try not to fall into the stress response you may be used to when interacting with your computer normally.\n\n## Two Kinds of Errors\n\nIn Python, there are two kinds of errors you will encounter frequently. One appears before the program runs, and the other appears during the execution of a program.\n\n**Syntax errors**: When you ask Python to run a program or execute a line in the REPL, it will first check to see if the program is valid Python code—that is, that it follows the grammatical or syntactical rules of Python. If it doesn't, before the program even runs, you'll see a syntax error printed out to the screen.\n\nIn this below example, the syntax error is a common one—mismatched single and double quotes, which is not allowed in Python. You can replicate the below error by opening the REPL (type `python` in the command line) and entering the line after the `>>>` prompt.\n\n```pycon\n>>> print('This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.\")\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    print('This string has mismatched quotes. But Python will help us figure out this bug.\")\n                                                                                           ^\nSyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\n```\n\nNote the caret (`^`) underneath the mismatched quote, helpfully pointing out where the error lies. Similarly, if this error happened when running a script, Python would tell us the filename and the line number for the line on which the error occurs.\n\n**Traceback errors**: These errors occur during the execution of a Python program when the program finds itself in an untenable state and must stop. Traceback errors are often logical inconsistencies in a program that is valid Python code. A common traceback error is referring to a variable that hasn't been defined, as below.\n\n```pycon\n>>> print(not_a_variable)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'not_a_variable' is not defined\n```\n\nTraceback errors try to tell you a little about what happened in the program that caused the problem, including the category of error, such as `NameError` or `TypeError`.\n\n## Debugging\n\nDebugging is a fancy word for fixing problems with a program. Here are some common strategies for debugging a program when first learning Python:\n\n- If the error is a syntax error:\n    - Look at where the caret is pointing.\n    - Pay attention to grammatical features such as quotes, parentheses, and indentation.\n    - Consider reading the program, or the offending line, backward. It's surprising, but this often helps to detect the issue.\n- If the error is a traceback error:\n    - First look at the line where the error occured, then consider the general category of error. What could have gone wrong?\n    - If the error is a name error (NameError), check your spelling.\n    - Try copying the last line of the error and pasting it into Google. You'll often find a quick solution this way.\n- If you changed the program and expect a different output, but are getting old output, you may not have saved the file. Go back and make sure the file has been correctly saved.\n\n## Challenge\n\nTry to create as many errors as you can in the next few minutes. After getting your first two syntax errors, try instead to get traceback errors. Some areas to try include mathematical impossibilities and using math operations on types that do not support them.\n\n## Solution\n\nSome examples of **syntax errors** include...\n\n- Starting the variable name with a special character.\n\n    ```pycon\n    >>> %greeting = \"Hello World\"\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n        %greeting = \"Hello World\"\n        ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    ```\n\n- Starting a variable by writing the data values before the variable.\n\n    ```pycon\n    >>> \"hey there!\" = greeting\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    SyntaxError: can't assign to literal\n    ```\n\n- Including spaces in a variable.\n\n    ```pycon\n    >>> pleasant greeting = \"Hello!\"\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n        pleasant greeting = \"Hello!\"\n                        ^\n    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n    ```\n\nSome examples of **traceback errors** include...\n\n- Concatenating data types, like strings and integers.\n\n    ```pycon\n    >>> greeting = \"hello\" + 1\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n    ```\n\n- Using Booleans (`True` or `False`) without capitalizing them.\n\n    ```pycon\n    >>> greeting = false\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    NameError: name 'false' is not defined\n\n    >>> greeting = False\n\n    >>> greeting\n    False\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIf you get an error, what can you do to debug it? Select all that apply:\n\n- If it's a _syntax error_, look for the caret as a starting point.*\n- If it's a _traceback error_, make sure all your variables are defined.*\n- Copy the error message into a Google search.*\n- Run spell check on your code.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Syntax Errors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/syntax_error.md)\n- [Traceback Errors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/traceback_error.md)\n\n# Functions\n\nBroadly defined, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Often, a function takes an input, transforms the input, and returns an output. Imagine, for instance, a [penny press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongated_coin) at a popular tourist attraction that accepts a penny (the input), flattens and embosses the penny (the transformation), and spits out an elongated coin with a new design, perhaps an image of the Statue of Liberty (the output)! Or, for those of you who remember high school algebra, the function `f(x) = x + 1` means that given an input `x`, the function will return `x + 1`. For example, if I substituted `2` for `x`, my function would read `f(2) = 2 + 1`, or `f(2) = 3`. In this case, my input was `2`, the transformation was to add `1`, and the output was `3`. These are the basic concepts that make up a function in Python as well! \n\n## Writing your first function\n\nIn a text editor, let's write a Python function that prints the output from our alegebraic equation `f(x) = x + 1` above:\n\n```python\ndef add_one(x):\n  print(x + 1)\n```\n\nLet's break that down. When creating a function, we begin by writing `def` before our chosen function name. The function name is typically descriptive in nature. We named the above function `add_one` following [Python naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names), as the function will be ADDING 1 to our inputted integer. We always need a closed parentheses `()` after our function name, which in this case, takes one argument (or input), which we will temporarily call `x` (we can name this parameter whatever we want, as long as we use the same name within the body of the function). Then, we end the first line with a `:`, return, and indent by 2 spaces to write code describing what this function should \"do.\" In this case, we want the function to `print` the result of adding `1` to our input, or `x`. Remember, we need parentheses every time we print something!\n\nNext, if we want to call our function from the terminal, we will need to actually pass in an argument to see a result! Let's add the following line of code below our function (make sure this next line isn't indented):\n\n```python\nadd_one(2)\n```\n\nHere, we are telling the computer to pass in `2` to see if we get our expected output of `3`. Now, save this file to your Desktop as `function.py`, and run the script from your terminal:\n\n```console\n$ cd Desktop\n$ python function.py\n```\n\nDid you get `3`? \n\n### Optional \nTo see the magic of the function in action, try going back to your text editor and adding extra lines of code with different arguments, making sure to hit \"save\" after doing so:\n\n```python\nadd_one(155)\nadd_one(5)\nadd_one(-1)\n```\n\nCall `function.py` again from the terminal. Do you notice how the function printed the sum of each of these numbers plus one? Writing this function helped us to automate this simple process of addition for each given input! Granted, creating a whole function just to add \"one\" to something may seem unnecessarily complicated, but once you have learned the basics of function-writing, the possibilities are powerful and limitless!\n\n### Advanced\nNote that writing a function this way only prints the result, but does not actually `return` it. Read more about the difference between `print` and `return` [here](https://pythonprinciples.com/blog/print-vs-return/). If we wanted our function to actually perform the operation AND print it, we could revise our code as follows:\n\n```python\ndef add_one(x):\n  return x + 1\n\nprint(add_one(2))\n```\n\n## Writing your second function\n\nOur functions do not have to be \"mathematical\" in nature. Let's say that I wanted to say a friendly hello, but didn't want to type out a long sentence every time I wanted to do so. I could automate this process by writing the following function:\n\n```python\ndef greet():\n  print(\"Hello! How are you today?\")\n```\n\nRemember, we also need to call the function if we want it to run. So, add the following line after your code:\n\n```python\ngreet()\n```\n\nSave the file as `greet.py`, and call it from your terminal. You might have noticed that this time, we didn't pass in an argument! Note that a function doesn't have to take an input (or argument), or it can take several arguments! There is a lot of flexibility involved in writing your own functions, which you can craft carefully to do exactly what you want them to! Read more about some of the many things you can do with functions on the online web tutorial [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp).\n\n## Challenge\n\nHow could we change our greeting function to say hello to a specific person? Hint: your print statement will need to use string interpolation. We did this in \"3. Variables\" when we assigned y to \"hello\" `y = \"hello\"`, and then added `y + \" and goodbye\"`, which yielded the result `\"hello and goodbye\"`.\n\n## Solution\n```python\ndef greet(person):\n  print(\"Hello \" + person + \"! How are you today?\")\n\ngreet(\"Sarah\")\n```\nThe result of calling this in your terminal prints `\"Hello Sarah! How are you today?\"`\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich of the following are not true about a function?:\n\n- A function can be reused\n- A function can take any number of arguments (including no arguments)\n- A function needs to be called in order to run\n- A function can only perform mathematical operations*\n\n## Keywords\n- [argument] - \"An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.\" -https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp\n- [parameter] - \"A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.\" -https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp \n- [function] A function is block of reusable code that performs a specific task.\n\n# Lists\n\nRemember lists? They look like this:\n\n```python\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n```\n\nFor now, let's just create a list and print it out. In a text editor, our script will look like this:\n\n```python\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\nprint(books)\n```\n\nSave this to a new file called `loop.py` and run it with `python loop.py`. You should see the list printed out in the terminal.\n\nSo far, we've only learned one function: `type()`. Let's try out another, called `len()`, which returns the number of items in a list or the number of characters in a string. \n\nFirst, let's \"comment out\" the `print(books)` statement with the hastag `#`, which tells python to ignore that line of code. Then, type out the following lines in your loop.py file:\n\n```python\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n# print(books)\n\nlist_length = len(book)\n\nprint(list_length)\n```\n\nLet's take apart this unfamiliar line of code: `list_length = len(book)`\n- First, we have saved a list of books to the variable, `books`.\n- Second, look to the next line this statement. `list_length = len(book)` takes the `books` variable from the previous line as an *argument* (or input data) for the `len()` function. That's why `books` is within the parenthesis. This syntax means that python will run the `len()` function on the items in `books`. Then, it sets the result of that process to a new variable, called `list_length`.\n- Finally, we print the `list_length` value.\n\nThis might appear a bit complex at first, but if you read the line slowly you should be able to connect the dots.\n\nNotice that when you run the code above, you don't see the `books` list printed out. That's because that line has become a comment. If you put a `#` (hash or pound) at the beginning of a line, that line will be ignored.\n\n## List Indexing\n\nA useful property of a list is the list index. This allows you to pick out an item from within the list by a number starting from zero:\n\n```python\nprint(books[0]) # Gender Trouble\nprint(books[1]) # Cruising Utopia\n```\n\nNote that the first item in the list is `item[0]`. The second item is `item[1]`. That's because counting in Python, and in almost all programming languages, starts from `0`.\n\nAdditionally, you can print out the last item in a list using negative numbers, where `-1` denotes the last item in the list:\n\n```python\nprint(books[-1]) # Living a Feminist Life\n```\n\n## Slicing Lists\n\nThere are many things you can do with list indexing, like slicing. Slicing consists of taking a section of a list, using the list index to pick out a range of list items. For example, you could take out the first _two_ items of a list with a slice that begins with `0` and ends with `2`.\n\nThe slice syntax consists of square brackets, start point and end point, and a colon to indicate the gap in between. This should print out the first two items of your list.\n\n```python\nprint(books[0:2])\n```\n\nNote a couple of things. First, the start point is *inclusive*, meaning that Python will include the `[0]` item in your range, and the end point is _exclusive_, so Python won't print the `[2]` item. Instead, it will print everything up until that `[2]` item.\n\nFor ultimate brevity, you can also write this expression as:\n\n```python\nprint(books[:2])\n```\n\nThe empty value before the colon allows Python to assume the range starts at the first list item, at `[0]`. You can also end the slice with `:`, if you want the list range to include all subsequent items until the end of the list. The example below will print everything from the second item to the end of the list.\n\n```python\nprint(books[1:])\n```\n\nWith a list that contains three items total, list slicing might not seem very impressive right now. However, this will become a powerful tool once we get to more sophisticated text analysis and start to encounter lists that contain hundreds (or thousands!) of items.\n\n## Challenge\n\nCreate a new list of books in the REPL, with at least 5 books in your list. Make sure the total number of books in the list is an **odd** number. How do you get python to print out the book in the middle of the list? What about the three books in the middle? Remember that the first value in a slice is _inclusive_, and the final value is _exclusive_.\n\n## Solution\n\n```pycon\n>>> books = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life', 'Radiant Textuality', 'The Undercommons']\n\n>>> books[2] # ['Living a Feminist Life']\n\n>>> books[1:4] # ['Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life', 'Radiant Textuality']\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nHow would you get Python to print the length of the last book in the list? Hint: this number reflects the length of the _string_ which is the last item in the list. Choose the correct expression from the options below.\n\n- `len(books)`\n- `print(books[-1])`\n- `print(len[-1])`\n- `print(len(books[-1]))`*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [list](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/list.md)\n- [list indexing](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/list_indexing.md)\n- [len()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/len.md)\n\n# Loops\n\nWhat if we want to print out each item in the list separately? For that, we'll need something called a loop:\n\n```python\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n# print(books)\n\nfor book in books:\n    print(\"My favorite book is \" + book)\n```\n\nWhat's happening here? This kind of loop is called a \"for loop\", and tells Python: \"for each item in the list, do something.\" Let's break it down:\n\n```python\nfor <variable name> in <list name>:\n    <do something>\n```\n\nIndented code like this is known as a \"code block.\" Python will run the `<do something>` code in the code block once for each item in the list. You can also refer to `<variable name>` in the `<do something>` block.\n\nYou can also loop through items within a string. For example, type the following into your `loop.py` file:\n\n```python\nfor letter in \"hello\":\n    print(letter)\n```\n\nThe result should print out each letter of the string `hello`, one by one.\n\n## A Note on Variable Names\n\nIn this section, we've discussed books in the context of a list. Why do we use the variable name `books` in this section for our list of book names? Why not just use the variable name `x`, or perhaps `f`?\n\nWhile the computer might not care if our list of books is called `x`, giving variables meaningful names makes a program considerably easier to read than it would be otherwise. Consider this for loop:\n\n```python\ny = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\n\nfor x in y:\n    print(x)\n```\n\nWhich is easier to read, this for loop or the one used in the example?\n\nWhen variable names accurately reflect what they represent, and are therefore meaningful, we call them \"semantic.\" Always try to create semantic variable names whenever possible.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. Here's a list of numbers:\n\n    ```python\n    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n    ```\n\n    Write some code to print out the square of each of these numbers. Remember that the square of a number is that number times itself. The solution is below, but you're not allowed to look at it until you've tried to solve it yourself for 3.5 minutes. (Seriously! That's 210 seconds.)\n\n2. First, ignore this challenge because it's too hard. Next, look up a new concept—\"f-string\" (a formatting technique for strings)—on Google and use it to write a loop that gives the following output:\n\n    ```pycon\n    The square of 2 is 4.\n    The square of 3 is 9.\n    The square of 5 is 25.\n    The square of 7 is 49.\n    The square of 11 is 121.\n    ```\n\n    Note: the \"f-string\" is a new string formatting method for Python 3. You can [read more about this new string formatting method](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#f-strings-a-new-and-improved-way-to-format-strings-in-python).\n\n## Solution\n\n1. To get the square of the elements in the list `prime_numbers`, you can:\n\n    ```python\n    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n\n    for num in prime_numbers:\n        print(num * num)\n    ```\n\n2. Using \"f-strings\" to output the list of results in the challenge would look something like this:\n\n    ```python\n    prime_numbers= [2,3,5,7,11]\n    for num in prime_numbers:\n        print(f\"The square of {num} is {num * num}\")\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat are different ways for describing what a \"for loop\" can do?\n\n- for each item in a list, multiply it against itself.*\n- print the contents of a list.*\n- add a new item to a list.\n- loop through characters in a string.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [for-loop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/for_loop.md)\n- [f-string](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/f-string.md)\n\n# Conditionals\n\nConditionals allow programs to change their behavior based on whether some statement is true or false. Let's try this out by writing a script that will give different outputs (consisting of book titles) based on the specified field of study:\n\n```python\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\n\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n```\n\nIn our first line, we set a variable `field` to the string `\"Media Studies\"`, representing our chosen field of study. The `if` statement checks whether the field is set to the string \"Media Studies\". If it is, the code in the block beneath is executed, so the string `\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\"` will be printed.\n\nIt's important to note at this point the use of the double equals sign `==` in `if` statements. The double equals is an _equality_ operator, and it checks to see if the two values on either side are equivalent. Contrast this with the single equals that you've already seen, `=`, which is an _assignment_ operator, that assigns a value to a variable. In the line `field = \"Media Studies\"`, you are using the assignment operator `=` to set the variable's value to \"Media Studies\", (a string) while in the `if` statement, you're using the equality operator `==` to check if the field is equivalent to \"Media Studies\".\n\nYou'll also notice the inclusion of a new line, the `else` statement. The `else` statement handles any inputs that aren't \"Media Studies\", and the program merely prints out that it doesn't know what you should bring.\n\n\nTry this script out both with the variable set to \"Media studies\" and the variable set to some other value, representing another field of study.\n\nWhat if we want our program to handle more fields of study, giving different messages for each one? Other cases after the first `if` statement are handled with `elif`, which is a shortened version of `else if`:\n\n```python\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\n\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n```\n\nYou can add as many `elif` statements as you need, meaning that conditionals in Python have one `if` statement, any number of `elif` statements, and one `else` statement that catches any input not covered by `if` or `elif`. Over the next sections, we'll work on improving this little application, making it able to handle user input directly.\n\n## Challenge\n\nAdd two more `elif` statements to this program to make it better able to handle different potential fields of study. Change the field of study a couple of times, making sure to save after each change, to test out your code.\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\n\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelif field == \"Critical Race Studies\"\n    print(\"The New Jim Crow\")\nelif field == \"DH Methodologies\"\n    print(\"Algorithmic Criticism\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat is the difference between the double equals (`==`) and single equals (`=`)?\n\n- The double equals checks to see if one value is equivalent to the other, as in `2 == 2`.*\n- The double equals assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left, as in `x == 2`.\n- The single equals checks to see if one value is equivalent to the other, as in `2 = 2`.\n- The single equals assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left, as in `x = 2`.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [if-Statement](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/if_statement.md)\n\n# Input\n\n**Note:** If you're using Python 2.7, replace all `input()` functions in the code below with `raw_input()`. You can check your version by running `python --version` in the command line.\n\n\nPython allows you to take input directly from the user using the `input()` function.\n\nLet's try it out by setting the function to a variable, which we will call `greeting`. Open the Python REPL and type:\n\n```pycon\n>>> greeting = input()\n```\n\nWhen you press <kbd>enter</kbd>, you should see a blank line. Type in your favorite greeting. I'm going to type `hey you!`. Then, press <kbd>enter</kbd>.\n\n```pycon\n>>> greeting = input()\nhey you!\n```\n\nPython has saved your input text to the variable `greeting`. When you type in `greeting` one more time, it will print out that input text. Pretty nifty, right?\n\n```pycon\n>>> greeting = input()\nhey you!\n\n>>> greeting\n'hey you!'\n```\n\nYou can play around with `input()` by adding some prompt text within the parenthesis. Whatever you put inside the parenthesis, enclosed by quotes, will prompt the user to type in their text, which is then assigned to the variable set to `input()`. Sounds complicated, so give it some practice:\n\n```pycon\n>>> feelings = input('How are you feeling today? ')\nHow are you feeling today?\n```\n\nNote that there's a little space after the question mark and before the closing quotation mark, which is to improve readability.\n\nWe can answer with `like a rollercoaster of emotions`. Then, when we type in our variable `feelings` and press enter, we'll get our input printed back at us.\n\n```pycon\n>>> feelings = input('How are you feeling today? ')\nHow are you feeling today? like a rollercoaster of emotions\n\n>>> feelings\n'like a rollercoaster of emotions'\n```\n\n## Challenge\n\nRemember this loop?\n\n```python\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\n\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n```\n\nNow, that we understand a bit about how `input()` works, let's use it to improve our book application. We are going to use `input()` to ask for the field before displaying the output. To do this, add one more line of code that sets the `field` variable to an `input()`. Make sure you include a little prompt that asks the user what book they want to select or read that day.\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nfield = input(\"Which field of study do you want to read about today? \")\n\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIf we wanted to calculate the length of an input using `len()`, how would we write that expression?\n\n- `input() = len()`\n- `response = len().input()`\n- `len(input()) = length_of_response`\n- `length_of_response = len(input())`*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [input()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/input.md)\n\n# Doing Things to Lists\n\nOkay. Let's make our little book application a little more robust. We are going to create a list of books (remember lists?) that we can then manipulate in all sorts of ways.\n\nFirst, go back to your terminal and enter the REPL, or Python's interactive mode. When you see the `>>>`, create a list with at least three books that are important to your research right now. Shorten the titles to one or two words if need be. Let's call this list our `library`. Remember the proper syntax for creating a list includes square brackets with commas separating the list items. Because the items are strings, they should also be inside quotes.\n\n```pycon\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\n```\n\nNext, let's sort our `library` in alphabetical order. There's a handy method called `sort()` for doing just this kind of thing. What's a _method_, you might ask? Well, _methods_ are very similar to _functions_, and you'll remember that functions are ways of doing things, like `print()` and `type()`. Methods are also ways of doing things, but these things are attached to what we call _objects_ in Python. Objects are part of object-oriented-programming, and that's definitely not necessary to learn right now. Suffice it to say that methods are just like functions, that is, they are ways of doing things to your data.\n\nTo sort the list, use the `sort()` method on your list. It should look like this:\n\n```pycon\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nlibrary.sort()\nprint(library)\n```\n\nWhat happened here? Let's take it line by line. First, we created a list `library` with three items attached to it. Then, we applied the `sort()` method to the library list. Finally, we printed the `library`, which is now sorted in alphabetical order.\n\nYou'll see that we have a couple of new things happening with symbols.\n- First, the period `.` which is an _operator_ in Python. The period operator is another part of object-oriented-programming, and it basically means that we are applying a task to whatever precedes the period. In this case, we are applying the `sort()` method to our `library` list. It's kind of like attaching a function to our `library`.\n- Second, we have the parenthesis `()` after `sort`. When you get more comfortable with programming, you'll often use the parentheses to include what we call _arguments_ that allows us to do more complex things to data. Let's see how an argument works with the `append()` method.\n\nWhat if we want to add items to the list? We can use the `append()` method for that. Try:\n\n```pycon\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nlibrary.append(\"La Frontera\")\nprint(library)\n```\n\nHere, we added `\"La Frontera\"` as an argument to the `append()` method by putting the string between the parenthesis. It basically means that we will be appending this specific title to the library list.\n\nWhen you print `library`, you should see your new book appear at the end of the list. Pretty cool, right? Go ahead and add a couple more books to your list.\n\nWhat if you wanted to take out some of the books? We can use `pop()` to remove the last item, or \"pop\" it off, from our list.\n\n```pycon\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\", \"La Frontera\", \"Dawn\"]\nlibrary.pop()\nprint(library)\n```\n\nThe last item that you added to your list should be missing from the `library` when you print the list.\n\n## Challenge\n\nRemember the `input()` function from the last lesson? This challenge uses that function in combination with what you know about list methods to create a little library app. You will play around with the input button, asking the user what kinds of things they want to do with their library, and writing some code that does those things and prints out the results.\n\nFirst, create a new file called `library.py`. Save it to your current working folder.\n\nSecond, create a list of `library` books, with at least three books (you can use the same ones as before).\n\n```python\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\n```\n\nThen, add an input statement that will save the user's response to a variable, like `response`.\n\n```python\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\n```\n\nNow, create a conditional statement that matches the user's response to series of options for doing things to the `library` list. You can include `sort()`, `append()`, and `pop()`. I'll do the first one, `sort()`, for you:\n\n```python\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\nif response == \"sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n```\n\nSee how the order of statements build on each other toward the final product? First, we create a library of books. Then, we set the user's response about what to do with those books. Then, we create a conditional statement that matches the response to specific tasks. The first condition checks to see if the user wants to \"sort\" the books, then sorts them, then prints the final result.\n\nAfter adding a few more conditions, test out your code! You should have a little library app that sorts, adds, and removes books from your list.\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\nif response == \"sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"add\":\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"remove\":\n    library.pop()\n    print(library)\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n```\n## Evaluation\n\nSelect the following statements that truly describe `sort()`, `append()`, and `pop()`.\n\n- methods are like functions which are attached to objects.*\n- `sort()`, `append()`, and `pop()` are functions.\n- `append()` always takes an argument.*\n- `pop()` can be applied to a string.\n\nAdvanced question: If you `sort()` the library in between adding and popping a book, you'll end up with a different list than if you didn't run sort() in between `append()` and `pop()`. Can you guess why?\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [append](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/append.md)\n- [sort()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/sort.md)\n- [pop()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/pop.md)\n\n# Finding Answers with Google\n\nOur library app is working pretty well, but you may have noticed that it's case sensitive:\n\n```\nWhat do you want to do with your books today?\nSort\nI don't know what you want me to do!\n```\n\nHow could we fix our program to handle cases like this? We could add a bunch of new `elif` statements, like this:\n\n```python\n...\nelif response == \"Sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"SORT\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\n...\n```\n\nThis is a lot of work, and it's a pretty ugly solution. If we wanted to add more cases to our program, we would have to write them in twice every time, and it still wouldn't fix inputs like `SorT`. The best way to improve our program would be to convert the input to lower case before we send it to our `if/else` block.\n\n## Googling for Answers\n\nEven if you're a super rad Python programmer, you're not going to remember every function name or how to do things you might not have touched in awhile. One thing programmers get very good at is googling for answers. In fact, this is arguably the most important skill in modern-day programming. So let's use Google to find out how to convert strings to lower case.\n\nLet's try the search term [make string lowercase](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=make+string+lowercase+Python):\n\n![make string lower case Python Google search](/images/python/google_search.png)\n\nWhile Google searches change over time, some of your results likely come from a site called Stack Overflow. This is a questions and answers site for programmers that usually has strong answers to questions about Python.\n\n![Google search results with stack overflow answer on top](/images/python/google_result.png)\n\nOn [this _Stack Overflow_ page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-do-i-lowercase-a-string-in-python), take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. Then scroll down to the answers to find what we're looking for. You may also notice snarky debates—another \"feature\" of _Stack Overflow_.\n\n## Implementing Our Answer\n\nAccording to this answer, we can make a string lowercase by adding `.lower()` to the end of it, like this:\n\n```pycon\n>>> \"SORT\".lower()\n'sort'\n```\n\nOK, that seems to work. Let's incorporate this transformation into our library app:\n\n```python\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\nresponse = response.lower()\n\nif response == \"sort\":\n    library.sort()\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"add\":\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\n    print(library)\nelif response == \"remove\":\n    library.pop()\n    print(library)\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n```\n\nThis new script should handle any combination of upper or lowercase characters. The new second line sets the response variable to a new value, `response.lower()`, which is a lowercase version of the original input.\n\nThere's no shame in googling for answers! Error messages are especially useful to google when you run into them. Keep an eye out for _Stack Overflow_ answers, as they tend to have useful examples. The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) will also frequently come up, but I would recommend avoiding it as a resource until you have more programming experience. It's a great resource, but the way information is presented can be confusing until you get the hang of reading documentation.\n\nBefore moving on to the next section, complete the first challenge below. This challenge will teach the skills necessary to complete write more advanced scripts in this workshop.\n\n## Challenge\n\n*Note: the first challenge is **required** in order to complete further sections.\n\n1. We are going to use `while` loops to get Python to repeat loops over and over again. This involves adding a `while` statement to your library app. The code should look like this, and it goes right after the `library` list and before your `input` statement.\n\n    ```python\n    while True:\n        ...\n    ```\n\n    Make sure that everything under `while True:` is indented (this creates a \"code block,\" or a group of lines that will be executed together).\n\n    To stop the loop, you can press <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> in the terminal. This stops the program from being run, what we call \"interrupting\" the program. You can also add a `break` statement somewhere in your code which will automatically exit the program. For example:\n\n    ```python\n        if response == \"sort\":\n            library.sort()\n            print(library)\n            break\n        ...\n        else:\n            print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n    ```\n\n    Once you get the loop to work, you can add more `elif` statements to add more books to the list. Then, run the program, adding books, sorting them and removing them. Read more about `while` loops [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp).\n\n2. (optional) OK, I told you not to look at the Python documentation. But doesn't that make you really want to go look at the Python documentation? How bad could this \"documentation\" really be? What terrible secrets might it hold?\n\n    Fine. Have a look at the [Python documentation on built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Here's how you would include a `while` statement in our library application:\n\n    ```python\n    library = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\n    while True:\n        response = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\n        response = response.lower()\n        if response == \"sort\":\n            library.sort()\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"add\":\n            library.append(\"La Frontera\")\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"add again\":\n            library.append(\"In the Dreamhouse\")\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"more books\":\n            library.append(\"Giovanni's Room\")\n            print(library)\n        elif response == \"moar\":\n            library.append(\"Nightwood\")\n            print(library)\n            break\n        elif response == \"remove\":\n            library.pop()\n            print(library)\n        else:\n            print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIf we wanted to make a string like `'hello'` uppercase, we would use the method `upper()`, in the following way:\n\n- `upper('hello')`\n- `upper().'hello'`\n- `'hello'.upper()`*\n- `'hello'(upper)`\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [lower()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/lower.md)\n- [Method](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/method.md)\n\n# A Little Motivation\n\nEarly on, we learned a bit about lists, which look like this:\n\n```python\n[\"Gender Trouble\", \"Cruising Utopia\", \"Living a Feminist Life\"]\n```\n\nWe're going to create a small application that will print a random motivational saying every time a user presses <kbd>enter</kbd>. Our first step will be to create a list of positive sayings:\n\n```python\nmotivational_phrases = [\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n    ]\n```\n\nYou're still using the same list format. Remember lists open with a square bracket `[`, have items separated with commas, and end with a square bracket `]`, like this:\n\n```python\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nHowever, our positivity list above spreads the list out over multiple lines for greater readability, which is allowed in Python. Remember that you can change the strings in the list to whatever phrases you choose.\n\n## Importing a module\n\nNow that we have our sayings, let's use it in conjunction with some functionality from a module that's built into Python: the `random` module.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nmotivational_phrases = [\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n    ]\n\nprint(random.choice(motivational_phrases))\n```\n\nThe `random.choice` function chooses a random item from a list and returns it. The `.` syntax indicates that the function is coming from the `random` library.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. As with our library app, this positive saying generator could be improved by making it so the program doesn't have to run again every time to get new output. Add a while loop for the final version. Remember to include a `break` statement or use <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to get out of the loop! Read more [about while loops here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp).\n\n2. The real point of this section is to learn `import`, which is where Python really starts to get interesting. Python comes with many libraries (importable collections of code), written by others that can be pulled into your program, allowing you to use that functionality. In this challenge, do a little research on Python libraries that might solve a problem for you or address a domain that you're interested in.\n\nThink of something you're interested in doing (statistics, text analysis, web scraping, quantitative analysis, processing Excel/PDF/image files) and search google \"<_thing you are interested in_> python library\". You're almost certain to find some useful results. For example, if you wanted to find Python libraries for dealing with cleaning up HTML files, you might search one of these:\n\n> working with html python library\n\n> html parser python library\n\nIn your research, you may also want to look at the libraries that come with Python. You can find a list of libraries in these libraries [here](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Here's how you could add a `while` loop to our positive saying generator:\n\n    ```python\n    import random\n\n    while True:\n        motivational_phrases = [\n            \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n            \"Programming! Yay!\",\n            \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n            ]\n\n        # Because this is input, the user will need to hit enter to see a new phrase\n        input(random.choice(motivational_phrases))\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhat is a module? Select all that apply:\n\n- A module is a file of code.*\n- Applications can incorporate many different modules.*\n- A module needs to be downloaded and installed.\n- A module needs to be imported with an `import` statement.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Modules](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/module.md)\n- [Random](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/random.md)\n- [while loops](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/while_loop.md)\n\n# Objects in Python\n\nObjects in Python (and other programming languages) are basically containers that can hold data and/or functions inside them. When a function is inside an object, we usually call the function a \"method.\" When data is inside an object, we usually call it an \"attribute.\" The terminology isn't that important, though. What we do need to know is that you can access these \"methods\" and \"attributes\" with a `.` (a dot or period).\n\nWhen we added `sort()`, `append()`, `pop()`, and `lower()` to our library app, we briefly saw how some methods contained inside certain objects in Python, like Lists (for sort, append, and pop), and String objects, like lower.\n\n```pycon\n>>> loud_greeting = \"HELLO!\"\n\n>>> loud_greeting.lower()\n'hello!'\n```\n\nMany, or most, objects in Python have methods that allow you to use them in different ways. As you move into using more advanced Python, you'll find that understanding what methods are available becomes more important.\n\n## Examining Objects\n\nWhen you encounter an object, how can you learn its methods and atributes so you can use them? There are two main ways. The first, and likely the most practical, is to read the documentation of the library you're using.\n\nHowever, you can also use the `dir()` function, which will tell you which methods and attributes are available in an object.\n\nLet's use the REPL for a moment—open it by typing `python` at the command line.\n\n```pycon\n>>> s = 'Hello, world!'\n\n>>> dir(s)\n['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__',\n...\n'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']\n```\n\nThe above output shows some of the methods and attributes for Python strings that can be accessed using the dot (`.`) syntax. Also, be aware that Python doesn't print all the possible methods and attributes, just what it considers to be most important. Also, when using `dir()`, you'll mostly want to ignore the methods and attributes that have underscores around them. They mainly have to do with the internals of the Python language. For now, ignore the information within underscores (like `__add__`) and focus on the stuff surrouned by single quotes (like `startswith`).\n\nYou can also use `dir()` to see what functions are available from Python libraries that you import. Try importing the `random` library again and see what you get when you enter `dir(random)`.\n\n```pycon\n>>> import random\n\n>>> dir(random)\n['BPF', 'LOG4', 'NV_MAGICCONST', 'RECIP_BPF', 'Random', 'SG_MAGICCONST', 'SystemRandom', 'TWOPI', '_BuiltinMethodType', '_MethodType', '_Sequence', '_Set', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', '_acos', '_bisect', '_ceil', '_cos', '_e', '_exp', '_inst', '_itertools', '_log', '_os', '_pi', '_random', '_sha512', '_sin', '_sqrt', '_test', '_test_generator', '_urandom', '_warn', 'betavariate', 'choice', 'choices', 'expovariate', 'gammavariate', 'gauss', 'getrandbits', 'getstate', 'lognormvariate', 'normalvariate', 'paretovariate', 'randint', 'random', 'randrange', 'sample', 'seed', 'setstate', 'shuffle', 'triangular', 'uniform', 'vonmisesvariate', 'weibullvariate']\n```\n\nTry entering other objects based on Python types we've already learned to the `dir()` function. For example, you might try `dir([1, 2, 3])` to see what methods are available when using lists.\n\n## Challenge\n\n*Advanced Final Challenge*:\n\nLet's try out a library for web scraping, called `requests`. It allows you to send queries over web browsers (which we call HTTP requests) in order to grab data from websites. It is a foundational module for web scraping tasks. While `requests` is relatively easy to grasp at first, it has a bit of a learning curve. With some practice, though, it can yield sophisticated web scraping results.\n\nFor this challenge, let's get some hands-on practice using `requests`, to scrape the surface of what it can do. Feel free to attempt as much of this challenge as you are comfortable with.\n\nFirst, import requests into your REPL:\n\n```pycon\n>>> import requests\n```\n\nThen, let's set up a request _object_. Basically, we will declare a variable `r` to represent the content from a website that we want to scrape. After the equal sign `=`, we call the `requests` module, and within that module, a method called `get`, which includes the parameter of the website URL, enclosed in single quotes. Like so:\n\n```pycon\n>>> import requests\n\n>>> r = requests.get('https://www.nytimes.com')\n```\n\nNow, let's examine that request object. Use the `dir` function to see what methods and attributes are available to `r`. Focus on the items within single quotes, rather than the underscores. Look up any of the items that seem interesting but unclear to you. Try to find out what at least one of these methods does, such as `encoding`. Can you try out some of these methods in the REPL? This would involve adding the dot operator `.` to your variable `r`, followed by the method.\n\nEven if you don't understand the results—that's okay! This is an advanced challenge, meant to expose you to the beginning of your exploration with this module. This is only the first step to running more robust web scraping experiments.\n\n## Solution\n\nFirst, checking out what methods are available to the `r` object:\n\n```pycon\n>>> dir(r)\n['__attrs__', '__bool__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__enter__', '__eq__', '__exit__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getstate__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__nonzero__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__setstate__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_content', '_content_consumed', '_next', 'apparent_encoding', 'close', 'connection', 'content', 'cookies', 'elapsed', 'encoding', 'headers', 'history', 'is_permanent_redirect', 'is_redirect', 'iter_content', 'iter_lines', 'json', 'links', 'next', 'ok', 'raise_for_status', 'raw', 'reason', 'request', 'status_code', 'text', 'url']\n```\n\nThen, trying out some of the methods:\n\n```pycon\n>>> r.status_code\n200\n\n>>> r.encoding\n'utf-8'\n\n>>> r.cookies\n<RequestsCookieJar[Cookie(version=0, name='nyt-a', value='04u7q0SFZ2OpnpLqevHY65', port=None, port_specified=False, domain='.nytimes.com', domain_specified=True, domain_initial_dot=True, path='/', path_specified=True, secure=True, expires=1627494229, discard=False, comment=None, comment_url=None, rest={'SameSite': 'none'}, rfc2109=False), Cookie(version=0, name='nyt-gdpr', value='1', port=None, port_specified=False, domain='.nytimes.com', domain_specified=True, domain_initial_dot=True, path='/', path_specified=True, secure=False, expires=1595979829, discard=False, comment=None, comment_url=None, rest={}, rfc2109=False), Cookie(version=0, name='nyt-geo', value='PT', port=None, port_specified=False, domain='.nytimes.com', domain_specified=True, domain_initial_dot=True, path='/', path_specified=True, secure=False, expires=1595979829, discard=False, comment=None, comment_url=None, rest={}, rfc2109=False), Cookie(version=0, name='nyt-purr', value='cfhspnahhu', port=None, port_specified=False, domain='.nytimes.com', domain_specified=True, domain_initial_dot=True, path='/', path_specified=True, secure=True, expires=1627494229, discard=False, comment=None, comment_url=None, rest={'SameSite: Lax': None}, rfc2109=False)]>\n\n```\n\nWhat do these methods do? For the `r.status_code`, the `200` return value means that the request was successful, because 200 is the HTTP code for a successful request. This is opposed to 400 codes, like 404 error, which indicates a failure to reach the website.\n\nThe most useful method, however, is likely `text`:\n\n```pycon\n>>> r.text\n...\n```\n\n`text` allows you to access the text content of the site you have requested, which is extremely useful when you want to scrape websites for information, for instance.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for using `requests`. In order to get more information, you'll have to read up on the module. Here is [an excellent tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-python-requests-get-requests) to get started.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhy would someone use `dir()`?

Rarely when I ask people \"what is data?\" do they respond \"_Moby Dick_.\" And yet, more and more, text is data. Whether it is _Moby Dick_, or every romance novel written since 1750, or today's newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized. That has been done for a while, but now we can do it in a much larger scale, in a much faster way.\n\n## Corpora\n\nThe first step in gathering insights from texts is to create a **corpus**. A corpus is a collection of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the [Corpus of Contemporary American English](https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/), [Donald Trump's Tweets](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/), [text messages](https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) sent by bilingual young adults, [digitized newspapers](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/), or [books](https://www.gutenberg.org/) in the public domain are all corpora. There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your own—that is, one that best fits your research question.\n\nThe route you take from here will depend on your research question. Let's say, for example, that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives than female-identified. So you collect two corpora—one written by men, one written by women—and you count the number of *the*s, *this*s, and *that*s compared to the number of *a*s, *an*s, and *one*s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don't. We can already see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question, but it is a start.\n\nKeep in mind that, oftentimes our analysis of gender assumes pre-existing gender roles that reproduce gender as a binary system. Some digital humanists have pointed out that, if gender is binary, then the relation between male and female will likely be one of opposition. As [Laura Mandell](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/5d9c1b63-7b60-42dd-8cda-bde837f638f4#ch01) says, the categories of \"male\" and \"female\" are socially constructed, and quantitative analysis practitioners should avoid jumping to conclusions about \"male\" and \"female\" styles of thinking and writing \"as if the M/F terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently referential and not discursively constituted.\"\n\nThere has been some research about how the [linguistic complexity of written language](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf) in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter). One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.\n\nFor example, the sentence:\n\n> I like the red bicycle.\n\nhas one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.\n\n> (**I** : Pronoun), (**like** : Verb), (**the** : Determiner), (**red** : Adjective), (**bicycle** : Noun)\n\nNLTK uses the [Penn Tree Bank Tag Set](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html). This is a very detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well. Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners, etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It's important to note here that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.\n\n## A Note About Languages\n\nEven though in this workshop we will use the English language in the examples, NLTK does support many other languages, due to amazing contributions from the Python Text Analysis community. The support, however, varies according to the desired task. Not all functions and tools will be available for all the supported languages. The good news is that the available tools keep growing in quantity and quality.\n\nIf you are planning to work with other languages than English, you will have to figure out what tools are available and how to use them. Unfortunately, it is not something that can be fully explained in a general workshop like this. Some times it is as easy as changing `stopwords.words(\"English\")` (a command we will teach you later) to `stopwords.words(\"Spanish\")`. Ocasionally, it will be harder than that. A search engine (Google, DuckDuckGo...) will be your best friend here.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich of the following sentences is correct:\n\n- A text is not data in itself, but can produce data if converted into numbers.\n- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging can help identifying verbs, adjectives and nouns in a text.*\n- A corpus is any collection of texts, independently of being related to each other or not.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [NLTK](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/nltk.md)\n\n# Cleaning and Normalizing\n\nGenerally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing style. So, once we have a corpus—whether that is one text or millions—we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going to need:\n\n- **Text normalization** is the process of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence. Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case, removing _stop words_, and either _stemming_ or _lemmatizing_ the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).\n\nYou probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the other terms may be new:\n\n- **Stop words** are words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure, but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK. However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished across a large number of texts.\n\n- **Stemming and lemmatizing** both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\" to  \"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).\n\nLanguage is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For example, I could say to you:\n\n> The house is burning.\n\nand you would understand me. You would also understand if I say\n\n> house burn.\n\nThe first has more information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is the same either way.\n\nIn going from the first sentence to the normalized words, we removed the stop words (_the_ and _is_), and removed punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (_burning_ becomes _burn_—though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning is usually desirable.\n\nThis is a very important topic in Machine Learning tutorials. For the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\" and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"\n\n## A Note on Ethics\n\nThe act of cleaning/normalizing subscribes text to predetermined categories of meaning, forcing meaning into existing \"boxes,\" so to speak. This doesn't mean that we should avoid cleaning or normalizing text, but that we should be aware of how some textual reductions have the potential to affect meaning. How does quantification reinforce differences or stratifications within our data? We have to be careful about the kinds of questions we are asking, and how we might be reproducing some of our assumptions in our inquiry.\n\nTo read more about ethics and text analysis, see Lauren Klein's \"[Distant Reading After Moretti](https://arcade.stanford.edu/blogs/distant-reading-after-moretti),\" where she questions, \"Instead of first asking what can be modeled—what phenomena we can track at scale—we might instead ask: what might be hidden in this corpus?”\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich one of the following sentences is correct:\n- Stop words are useless for text analysis, therefore the first step in any project is to remove them from the text.\n- In any type of data analysis, we usually want to cleanse the data in order to prepare it for the analysis. In text analysis, this process is called \"text normalization\" and can involve tasks such as removing undesired words and punctuation.*\n- Textual alterations can potentially change the original intended meaning. Therefore, we must always strive to work with the data exactly as it is in the source.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/machine-learning.md)\n- [Text Normalization](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/text-normalization.md)\n\n# Using the NLTK Corpus\n\nIn the following sections, we are going to learn how to work with the NLTK Corpus and go through a series of methods that come built-in to NLTK that allow us to turn our words into numbers and visualizations.\n\nAll of the code for this section is in a [Jupyter Notebook file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/text-analysis/v2.0/files/TextAnalysisWalkthrough.ipynb). You should download it and save it on your desired folder. Here, we are assuming you are saving in in the `files` folder inside the `text-analysis` folder.\n\nIn this file you will find all of the workshop commands and the expected outputs. If you ever feel stuck or can't seem to be able to advance in the workshop, you can open this file and see how we did it. Feel free to open the file right now (click on it), take a peek at its contents if you want, and close it.\n\nTo do it, open your Jupyter Notebook, and navigate to the `files` folder inside the `text-analysis` folder. Click on the `TextAnalysisWalkthrough.ipynb` file. Once you are done, just close the tab.\n\n![image of the Jupyter Notebook for this workshop](/images/text-analysis/TextAnalysisWalkthrough.png)\n\nFor the best possible experience, we suggest/encourage you to:\n- Create an `.ipynb` file and follow the workshop typing all the code yourself.\n- Avoid copying/pasting the code. Much of learning has to do with you typing yourself.\n- Only check the `TextAnalysisWalkthrough.ipynb` file if you get lost or if you are not able to get the right output. Before opening it, put some time trying to figure out by yourself why it isn't working. A big part of coding is learning to identify what we are doing wrong.\n- I would also caution you against working with both files open at the same time. It is easy to get confused and start modifying the wrong one.\n\nBut those are only suggestions. Maybe they will work for you, maybe they won't, so feel free to do as it best suit you. You are in charge here!\n\n## Creating a Jupyter Notebook File\n\nNow you will create your Jupyter notebook file, in which you will run the workshop. Return to the Jupyter Home Tab in your Browser (or, if you closed it completely, launch the Jupyter Notebook again), and start a New Python Notebook using the `New` button in the upper right corner.\n\nEven though Jupyter Notebook doesn't force you to do so, it is very important to name your file, or you will end up later with a bunch of untitled files and you will have no idea what they are about. In the top left, click in the word `Untitled` and give your file a name such as \"intro_nltk\".\n\n![image of a new jupyter notebook file](/images/text-analysis/change_title.jpg)\n\nIn the first blank cell, type the following to import the NLTK library:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n```\n\n**Libraries** are sets of instructions that Python can use to perform specialized functions. The Natural Language ToolKit (`nltk`) is one such library. As the name suggests, its focus is on language processing.\n\nWe will also need the `matplotlib` library later on, so import it now:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\n```\n\n`matplotlib` is a library for making graphs. In the middle of this tutorial, we are going to make a dispersion plot of words in our texts.\n\nFinally, because of a quirk of Jupyter notebooks, we need to specify that `matplotlib` should display its graphs in the notebook (as opposed to in a separate window), so we type this command (this is technically a Jupyter command, not Python):\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\n```\n\nAll three of these commands can be written in the same cell and run all at once (<kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>) or in different cells.\n\n![Image showing that the three lines given above can be written in a single cell in the Jupyter notebook, one after another](/images/text-analysis/imports.png)\n\nIf you don't see an error when you run the notebook—that is, if there is no output—you can move on to the next step. It is not rare in programming that when you do things right, the result will be nothing happening. This is what we like to call a _silent success_.\n\nNext, we need to load all of the NLTK corpora into our program. Even though we downloaded them to our computer, we need to tell Python we want to use them.\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.book import *\n```\n\nThe pre-loaded NLTK texts should appear again. These are preformatted data sets. We will still have to do some minor processing, but having the data in this format saves us a few steps. At the end of this tutorial, we will make our own corpus. This is a special type of python object specific to NLTK (it isn't a string, list, or dictionary). Sometimes it will behave like a string, and sometimes like a list of words.\n\n![Image showing a second cell with the output of \"from nltk.book import *\"](/images/text-analysis/nltkbook.png)\n\nNotice that each of the texts already have a variable name. _Moby Dick_ is `text1`, _Sense and Sensibility_ is `text2`, and so on. When we want to work with those books, we will call them by their variable name, as you'll see soon.\n\nIf you got any error messages, check the code and make sure you typed everything correctly. Even spaces before words matter!\n\nIf you are sure you are running the code correctly, you probably have an installing issue, so you might have to go back to the instalation instructions to figure it out.\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Corpus](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/corpus.md)\n- [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/jupyter-notebook.md)\n- [Library](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/library.md)\n- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/matplotlib.md)\n\n# Searching for Words\n\nLet's start by analyzing _Moby Dick_, which is `text1` for NLTK.\n\nThe first function we will look at is `concordance`. \"Concordance\" in this context means the characters on either side of the word. Our text is behaving like one giant string, so concordance will just count the number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either side of our target word (including spaces), but [you can change that if you want](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/text.html#Text.concordance).\n\nIn the Jupyter Notebook, type:\n\n```python\ntext1.concordance(\"whale\")\n```\n\nThe output shows us the 25 characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in _Moby Dick_. Let's try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in _Moby Dick_. `concordance` is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions, including `similar` and `common_contexts`.\n\nLet's now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has a built-in function for this as well: `similar`.\n\n```python\ntext1.similar(\"love\")\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears. It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts. This is somewhat interesting in itself, but more interesting if we compare it to something else. Let's take a look at another text. What about _Sense and Sensibility_ (`text2`)? Let's see what words are similar to \"love\" in Jane Austen's writing. In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\ntext2.similar(\"love\")\n```\n\nWe can compare the two and see immediately that Melville and Austen use the word \"love\" differently.\n\n## Investigating \"lol\"\n\nLet's expand from novels for a minute and take a look at the NLTK Chat Corpus. In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\" is exceedingly common. We know it doesn't simply mean \"laughing out loud\"—maybe the `similar` function can provide some insight into what it does mean.\n\n```python\ntext5.similar(\"lol\")\n```\n\nThe resulting list is a lot of greetings, indicating that \"lol\" probably has more of a [phatic function](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100321840). Phatic language is language primarily for communicating social closeness. Phatic words stand in contrast to semantic words, which contribute meaning to the utterance.\n\nIf you are interested in this type of analysis, take a look at the `common_contexts` function in the [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) or in the [NLTK docs](https://www.nltk.org/).\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich one of the following sentences is correct?\n- The similar method brings a list of words that are similiar in writing, but not necessarily in meaning, like \"whale\" and \"while\".\n- Using the `concordance` method with a specific word, such as \"whale\", returns the words that surround \"whale\" in different sentences, helping us to get a glimpse of the contexts in which the word \"whale\" shows up.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Concordance](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/concordance.md)\n- [Phatic Language](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/phatic-language.md)\n\n# Positioning Words\n\nIn many ways, `concordance` and `similar` are heightened word searches that tell us something about what is happening near the target words. Another metric we can use is to visualize where the words appear in the text. In the case of _Moby Dick_, we want to compare where \"whale\" and \"monster\" appear throughout the text. In this case, the text is functioning as a list of words, and will make a mark where each word appears, offset from the first word. We will _pass_ this _function_ a _list_ of _strings_ to plot. In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\ntext1.dispersion_plot([\"whale\", \"monster\"])\n```\n\nA graph should appear with a tick mark everywhere that \"whale\" appears and everywhere that \"monster\" appears. Knowing the story, we can interpret this graph and align it to what we know of how the narrative progresses, helping us develop a visual of the story — where the whale goes from being a whale to being a monster to being a whale again. If we did not know the story, this could give us hints of the narrative arc.\n\n## Challenge\n\nTry this with `text2`, _Sense and Sensibility_, [as we saw here](#downloading-the-corpus). Some relevant words are \"marriage,\" \"love,\" \"home,\" \"mother,\" \"husband,\" \"sister,\" and \"wife.\" Pick a few to compare. You can compare an unlimited number, but it's easier to read a few at a time. (Note that the comma in our writing here is _inside_ the quotation mark, because that is how proper English grammar works. However, in Python, you would have to put commas _outside_ of the quotation marks to create a _list_.)\n\nNLTK has many more functions built-in, but some of the most powerful functions are related to cleaning, part-of-speech tagging, and other stages in the text analysis pipeline (where the pipeline refers to the process of loading, cleaning, and analyzing text).\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\ntext2.dispersion_plot([\"love\", \"marriage\"])\n```\n\n```python\ntext2.dispersion_plot([\"husband\", \"wife\"])\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\n- You can get a visual representation of ocurrences of a word with the `dispersion_plot` method.*\n- The `dispersion_plot` method allows you to input a list of strings, as long as you split them with commas.*\n- Contrary to grammar rule, in a list of strings, the commas must come outside of the quotation marks.*\n\n# Types vs. Tokens\n\nWe will now turn our attention away from the NLTK library and work with our text using the _built-in Python functions_, the ones that come included with the Python language, rather than the NLTK library. (This difference is relevant because built-in python functions will work with any list of strings, while some of the functions that are specific to the NLTK library will require you to make your text \"nltk ready\". Don't worry about that now, we will show you how to do it later in this workshop).\n\nFirst, let's find out how many times a given word appears in the corpus. In this case (and all cases going forward), our text will be treated as a list of words. Therefore, we will use the `count` function. We could just as easily do this with a text editor, but performing this in Python allows us to save it to a variable and then utilize this statistic in other calculations (for example, if we want to know what percentage of words in a corpus are 'lol', we would need a count of the 'lol's). In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\ntext1.count(\"whale\")\n```\n\nWe see that \"whale\" occurs 906 times, but that seems a little low. Let's check the same thing, but now for \"Whale\" and \"WHALE\":\n\n```python\ntext1.count(\"Whale\")\n```\n\n```python\ntext1.count(\"WHALE\")\n```\n\nWhat is clear here is that the `count` method is case-sensitive.\n\"Whale\" with a capital \"W\" appears 282 times, and \"WHALE\" another 38 times. Depending on the type of analysis, this distinction can be a problem, and we might want \"whale\", \"Whale\" and \"WHALE\" to be collapsed into one single word. We will deal with that in a moment. For the time being, we will accept that we have three different entries for \"whale.\"\n\nThis gets at a distinction between **type** and **token**. \"Whale\" and \"whale\" are different types (as of now) because they do not match identically. Every instance of \"whale\" in the corpus is another **token**—it is an instance of the type, \"whale.\" Therefore, there are 906 tokens of \"whale\" in our corpus, 282 tokens of \"Whale\" and 38 tokens of \"WHALE\".\n\nBut that's not what we want. Let's fix this by making all of the words lowercase. We will make a new list of words, and call it `text1_tokens`. We will fill this list with all the words in `text1`, but in their lowercase form. Python has a built-in function, `lower()` that takes all letters and makes them lowercase. In this same step, we are going to do a kind of tricky move, and only keep the words that are alphabetical and pass over anything that is punctuation or numbers. There is a built-in function, `isalpha()`, that will allow us to save only those words that are made of letters. If `isalpha()` is true, we'll make the word lowercase, and keep the word. If not, we'll pass over it and move to the next one.\n\nType the following code into a new cell in your notebook. Pay special attention to the indentation, which must appear as below. (Note that in Jupyter Notebook, indentation usually comes automatically. If not, make sure to type the <kbd>space</kbd> key 4 times)\n\n```python\ntext1_tokens = []\nfor t in text1:\n    if t.isalpha():\n        t = t.lower()\n        text1_tokens.append(t)\n```\n\nIf everything went right, you should get no output. Remember the \"silent success?\"\n\nAnother way to perform the same action more tersely is to use what's called a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions). A list comprehension is a shorter, faster way to write a for-loop. It is syntactically a little more difficult to read (for a human), but, in this case, it's much faster to process.\n\nDon't worry too much about understanding the syntax of list comprehensions right now, just try to recognize on it the elements you've seen in the for loop. For every example, we will show both the for loop and list comprehension options so you can slowly get used to the latter.\n\n```python\ntext1_tokens = [t.lower() for t in text1 if t.isalpha()]\n```\n\n## Take a Breath\n\nLet's take a breath, because this was a difficulty spike. For loops are weird and not super intuitive. It usually takes some time for us to get used to them.\n\nI suggest going back to the loop above, review it, try to understand why all indentations are where they are.\n\nFeel like you understand it? Try deleting it and writing the loop yourself without looking at this guide.\n\nYou can also copy the whole loop to a new jupyter notebook cell and play around with it. What happens when you change the order of the commands? How about the indentation? Don't be afraid to break it.\n\nIf you feel like you are done playing with the loop, time to move to the next section to see the results.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\n- \"Whale\", \"WHALE\", and \"whale\" are all different tokens of the same type.\n- The `lower()` method returns the lowercase form of all of the alphabetical characters in a string.*\n- The `isalpha()` method transforms integers in alphabetical strings.\n- The `append()` method adds an item to the end of the list.*\n\n## Token\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Token](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/token.md)\n- [Tokenizing](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tokenizing.md)\n- [Type](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/type.md)\n\n# Length and Unique Words\n\nGreat! Now `text1_tokens` is a list of all of the tokens in our corpus, with the punctuation removed, and all the words in lowercase. Let's check it:\n\n```python\ntext1_tokens.count(\"whale\")\n```\n\nAnd now we have 1226 tokens for \"whale\", which is the exact some of the counts we did before. To double check, count \"Whale\" and \"WHALE\" again and you should see no results for them.\n\nNow we want to know how many words there are in our corpus—that is, how many tokens in total. Therefore, we want to ask, \"What is the length of that list of words?\" Python has a built-in `len` function that allows you to find out the length of many types. Pass it a list, and it will tell you how many items are in the list. Pass it a string, and it will tell you how many characters are in the string. Pass it a dictionary, and it will tell you how many items are in the dictionary. In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\nlen(text1_tokens)\n```\n\nJust for comparison, check out how many words were in `text1`—before we removed the punctuation and the numbers.\n\n```python\nlen(text1)\n```\n\nWe see there are over 218,000 words in _Moby Dick_ (including metadata). But this is the number of words total—we want to know the number of unique words. That is, we want to know how many _types_, not just how many tokens.\n\nIn order to get unique words, rather than just all words in general, we will make a **set** from the list. A `set` in Python works just like it would [in math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)), it's all the unique values, with any duplicate items removed.\n\nSo let's find out the length of our set. just like in math, we can also nest our functions. So, rather than saying `x = set(text1_tokens)` and then finding the length of \"x\", we can do it all in one step.\n\n```python\nlen(set(text1_tokens))\n```\n\n# Lexical Density\n\nNow we can calculate the **lexical density**, the number of unique words per total words. [Statistical studies](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2a8/56959d7f5880c98ccd4cfeb4b4f5b7133ec7.pdf) have shown that lexical density is a good metric to approximate lexical diversity—the range of vocabulary an author uses. For our first pass at lexical density, we will simply divide the number of unique words by the total number of words:\n\n```python\nlen(set(text1_tokens)) / len(text1_tokens)\n```\n\nIf we want to use this metric to compare texts, we immediately notice a problem. Lexical density is dependent upon the length of a text and therefore is strictly a comparative measure. It is possible to compare 100 words from one text to 100 words from another, but because language is finite and repetitive, it is not possible to compare 100 words from one to 200 words from another. Even with these restrictions, lexical density is a useful metric in grade level estimations, [vocabulary use](http://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/2/3/7) and genre classification, and a reasonable proxy for lexical diversity.\n\nLet's take this constraint into account by working with only the first 10,000 words of our text. First we need to slice our list, returning the words in position 0 to position 9,999 (we'll actually write it as \"up to, but not including\" 10,000).\n\n```python\ntext1_slice = text1_tokens[0:10000]\n```\n\nNow we can do the same calculation we did above:\n\n```python\nlen(set(text1_slice)) / len(text1_slice)\n```\n\nThis is a much higher number, though the number itself is arbitrary. When comparing different texts, this step is essential to get an accurate measure.\n\n## Challenge\n\nLet's compare the lexical density of _Moby Dick_ with _Sense and Sensibility_. Make sure to:\n\n1. Make all the words lowercase and remove punctuation.\n2. Make a slice of the first 10,000 words.\n3. Calculate lexical density by dividing the length of the set of the slice by the length of the slice.\n\nRemember to be aware of the ethical implications for the conclusions that we might draw about our data. What assumptions might we be reifying about these writers?\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\ntext2_tokens = []\nfor t in text2:\n    if t.isalpha():\n        t = t.lower()\n        text2_tokens.append(t)\n\ntext2_slice = text2_tokens[0:10000]\n\nlen(set(text2_slice)) / len(text2_slice)\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\n- The `len` method returns the length of the input, which can mean different things depending on its type. If it is a string, it will return the number of characters; if it is a list or dictionary, it will return the number of items.*\n- The lexical density measures the number of unique words per total word, and it is an objective measure of writing quality.\n- Comparing the lexical density between texts of different sizes can give a problematic result. A possible solution is to use list slice and compare parts of both texts of a similar size.*\n\n# Data Cleaning: Removing Stop Words\n\nThus far, we have been asking questions that take stop words and grammatical features into account. For the most part, we want to exclude these features since they don't actually contribute very much semantic content to our models. Therefore, we will:\n\n1. Remove capitalization and punctuation (we've already done this).\n2. Remove stop words.\n3. Lemmatize (or stem) our words, i.e. \"jumping\" and \"jumps\" become \"jump.\"\n\nWe already completed step one, and are now working with our `text1_tokens`. Remember, this variable, `text1_tokens`, contains a list of strings that we will work with. We want to remove the stop words from that list. The NLTK library comes with fairly comprehensive lists of stop words for many languages. Stop words are function words that contribute very little semantic meaning and most often have grammatical functions. Usually, these are function words such as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, and others.\n\nTo use NLTK's stop words, we need to import the list of words from the corpus. (We could have done this at the beginning of our program, and in more fully developed code, we would put it up there, but this works, too.) In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n```\n\nWe need to specify the English list, and save it into its own variable that we can use in the next step:\n\n```python\nstops = stopwords.words('english')\n```\n\nNow let's take a look at those words:\n\n```python\nprint(stops)\n```\n\nNow we want to go through all of the words in our text, and if that word is in the stop words list, remove it from our list. Otherwise, we want it to skip it. (The code below is slow, so it may take some time to process). The way we can write this in Python is:\n\n```python\ntext1_stops = []\nfor t in text1_tokens:\n    if t not in stops:\n        text1_stops.append(t)\n```\n\nA faster option, if you are feeling bold, would be using list comprehension:\n\n```python\ntext1_stops = [t for t in text1_tokens if t not in stops]\n```\n\nTo check the result:\n\n```python\nprint(text1_stops[:30])\n```\n\n## Verifying List Contents\n\nNow that we removed our stop words, let's see how many words are left in our list:\n\n```python\nlen(text1_stops)\n```\n\nYou should get a much lower number.\n\nFor reference, let's also check how many unique words there are. We will do this by making a set of words. Sets are the same in Python as they are in math, they are all of the unique words rather than all the words. So, if \"whale\" appears 200 times in the list of words, it will only appear once in the set.\n\n```python\nlen(set(text1_stops))\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\n- Stop words are words that usually don't contribute with much semantic content, like prepositions, determiners, etc.*\n- To use stop words we need to import them from the nltk corpus, using the following code: `import stopwords from nltk.corpus`\n- List comprehensions are faster ways of iterating and creating lists when compared with for loops.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Stop Words](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/stop-words.md)\n\n# Data Cleaning: Lemmatizing Words\n\nNow that we've removed the stop words from our corpus, the next step is to stem or lemmatize the remaining words. This means that we will strip off the grammatical structure from the words. For example, `cats ⭢ cat`, and `walked ⭢ walk`. If that was all we had to do, we could stem the corpus and achieve the correct result, because stemming (as the name implies) really just means cutting off affixes to find the root (or the stem). Very quickly, however, this gets complicated, such as in the case of `men ⭢ man` and `sang ⭢ sing`. Lemmatization deals with this by looking up the word in a reference and finding the appropriate root (though note that this still is not entirely accurate). Lemmatization, therefore, takes a relatively long time, since each word must be looked up in a reference. NLTK comes with pre-built stemmers and lemmatizers.\n\nWe will use the WordNet Lemmatizer from the NLTK Stem library, so let's import that now:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n```\n\nBecause of the way that it is written \"under the hood,\" an instance of the lemmatizer needs to be called. We know this from reading [the docs](https://www.nltk.org/).\n\n```python\nwordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n```\n\nLet's quickly see what lemmatizing does.\n\n```python\nwordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"children\")\n```\n\nNow try this one:\n\n```python\nwordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"better\")\n```\n\nIt didn't work, but...\n\n```python\nwordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"better\", pos='a')\n```\n\n... sometimes we can get better results if we define a specific part of speech(pos). \"a\" is for \"adjective\", as we learned [here](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/wordnet.html).\n\nNow we will lemmatize the words in the list.\n\n```python\ntext1_clean = []\nfor t in text1_stops:\n    t_lem = wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(t)\n    text1_clean.append(t_lem)\n```\n\nAnd again, there is a faster version for you to use once you feel comfortable with list comprehensions:\n\n```python\ntext1_clean = [wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in text1_stops]\n```\n\n## Verifying Clean List Contents\n\nLet's check now to see the length of our final, cleaned version of the data, and then check the unique set of words. Notice how we will use the `print` function this time. Jupyter Notebook does print commands without the `print` function, but it will only print one thing per cell (the last command), and we wanted to print two different things:\n\n```python\nprint(len(text1_clean))\nprint(len(set(text1_clean)))\n```\n\nIf everything went right, you should have the same length as before, but a smaller number of unique words. That makes sense since we did not remove any word, we only changed some of them.\n\nNow if we were to calculate lexical density, we would be looking at how many word stems with semantic content are represented in _Moby Dick_, which is a different question than the one in our first analysis of lexical density.\n\nWhy don't you try that by yourself? Try to remember how to calculate lexical density without looking back first. It is ok if you have forgotten.\n\nNow let's have a look at the words Melville uses in _Moby Dick_. We'd like to look at all of the _types_, but not necessarily all of the _tokens._ We will order this set so that it is in an order we can handle. In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\nsorted(set(text1_clean))[:30]\n```\n\n`sorted` combined with `set` should give us a list of all the unique words in _Moby Dick_ in alphabetical order, but we only want to see the first ones. Notice how there are some words we wouldn't have expected, such as 'abandon', 'abandoned', 'abandonedly', and 'abandonment'. This process is far from perfect, but it is useful. However, depending on your goal, a different process, like _stemming_ might be better.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\n- Stemming and lemmatizing are different forms of reducing word variations to their roots.*\n- `sorted(set(list_of_strings))` returns the unique items of `list_of_strings` in alphabetical order.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Lemmatization](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/lemmatization.md)\n- [Lexical Density](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/lexical-density.md)\n\n# Data Cleaning: Stemming Words\n\nThe code to implement this and view the output is below:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\nporter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n```\n\nThe Porter is the most common Stemmer. Let's see what stemming does to words and compare it with lemmatizers:\n\n```python\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('berry'))\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('berries'))\nprint(wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize('berry'))\nprint(wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize('berries'))\n```\n\nStemmer doesn't look so good, right? But how about checking how stemmer handles some of the words that our lemmatized \"failed\" us?\n\n```python\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandon'))\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandoned'))\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandonedly'))\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandonment'))\n```\n\nStill not perfect, but a bit better. So the question is, how to choose between stemming and lemmatizing? As many things in text analysis, that depends. The best way to go is experimenting, seeing the results and chosing the one that better fits your goals.\n\nAs a general rule, stemming is faster while lemmatizing is more accurate (but not always, as we just saw). For academics, usually the choice goes for the latter.\n\nAnyway, let's stem our text with the Porter Stemmer:\n\n```python\nt1_porter = []\nfor t in text1_clean:\n    t_stemmed = porter_stemmer.stem(t)\n    t1_porter.append(t_stemmed)\n```\n\nOr, if we want a faster way:\n\n```python\nt1_porter = [porter_stemmer.stem(t) for t in text1_clean]\n```\n\nAnd let's check the results:\n\n```python\nprint(len(set(t1_porter)))\nprint(sorted(set(t1_porter))[:30])\n```\n\nA very different list of words is produced. This list is shorter than the list produced by the lemmatizer, but is also less accurate, and some of the words will completely change their meaning (like 'berry' becoming 'berri').\n\n## Evaluation\n\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\n- Both Stemming and Lemmatizing are far from perfect, so they must be used with caution.*\n- There is no obvious best choice between Stemmers and Lemmatizers, so the best way to go is experimenting and seeing what results better fit your goals.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Stemming](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/stemming.md)\n\n# Data Cleaning: Results\n\nNow that we've seen some of the differences between both, we will proceed using our lemmatized corpus, which we saved as `text1_clean`:\n\n```python\nmy_dist = FreqDist(text1_clean)\n```\n\nIf nothing happened, that is normal. Check to make sure it is there by calling for the type of the \"my_dist\" object.\n\n```python\ntype(my_dist)\n```\n\nThe result should say it is a nltk probability distribution (`nltk.probability.FreqDist`). It doesn't matter too much right now what that is, only that it worked. We can now plot this with `matplotlib`'s function called `plot`. We want to plot the first 20 entries of the `my_dist` object.\n\n```python\nmy_dist.plot(20)\n```\n\n![nltk plot distribution](/images/text-analysis/nltk_plot.png)\n\nWe've made a nice image here, but it might be easier to comprehend as a list. Because this is a special probability distribution object we can call the `most_common` on this, too. Let's find the twenty most common words:\n\n```python\nmy_dist.most_common(20)\n```\n\nWhat about if we are interested in a list of specific words—perhaps to identify texts that have biblical references. Let's make a (short) list of words that might suggest a biblical reference and see if they appear in _Moby Dick_. Set this list equal to a variable:\n\n```python\nb_words = ['god', 'apostle', 'angel']\n```\n\nThen we will loop through the words in our cleaned corpus, and see if any of them are in our list of biblical words. We'll then save into another list just those words that appear in both.\n\n```python\nmy_list = []\nfor word in b_words:\n    if word in text1_clean:\n        my_list.append(word)\n    else:\n        pass\n```\n\nAnd then we will print the results.\n\n```python\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nYou can obviously do this with much larger lists and even compare entire novels if you wish, though it would take a while with this approach. You can use this to get similarity measures and answer related questions.\n\n## Challenge\n\n1. Try to get the same result of the loop above (the one with \"my_list\"), but this time with a list comprehension. Save this other list as \"my_list2\".\n\n2. Compare both lists to see if they are identical.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. A solution using a list comprehension would look like this:\n\n    ```python\n    my_list2 = [word for word in b_words if word in text1_clean]\n    ```\n\n2. To compare the lists, you could run the following command:\n\n    ```python\n    my_list == my_list2\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich one of the following sentences is correct:\n\n- We can create a frequency distribution of a list of strings with `FreqDist` and plot it with the `plot` method.*\n- `my_dist.most_common(50)` will check the first 50 words in the distribution and return you the most common one among them.\n\n# Make Your Own Corpus\n\nNow that we have seen and implemented a series of text analysis techniques, let's go to the Internet to find a new text. You could use something such as historic newspapers, or Supreme Court proceedings, or use any txt file on your computer. Here we will use [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org). Project Gutenberg is an archive of public domain written works, available in a wide variety of formats, including `.txt`. You can download these to your computer or access them via the url. We'll use the latter. We found _Don Quixote_ in the archive (see [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt)), and will work with that.\n\nThe Python package `urllib` comes installed with Python, but is inactive by default, so we still need to import it to utilize the functions. Since we are only going to use the urlopen function, we will just import that one.\n\nIn the next cell, type:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n```\n\nThe `urlopen` function allows your program to interact with files on the internet by opening them. It does not read them, however—they are just available to be read in the next line. This is the default behavior any time a file is opened and read by Python. One reason is that you might want to read a file in different ways. For example, if you have a _really_ big file—think big data—you might want to read line-by-line rather than the whole thing at once.\n\nNow let's specify which URL we are going to use. Though you might be able to find _Don Quixote_ in the Project Gutenberg files, please type this in so that we are all using the same format (there are multiple `.txt` files on the site, one with utf-8 encoding, another with ascii encoding). We want the utf-8 encoded one. The difference between these is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can check out this [introduction to character encoding](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding) from The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) if you are interested.\n\nSet the URL we want to a variable:\n\n```python\nmy_url = \"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt\"\n```\n\nWe still need to open the file and read the file. You will have to do this with files stored locally as well. (in which case, you would type the path to the file (i.e., `data/texts/mytext.txt`) in place of `my_url`)\n\n```python\nfile = urlopen(my_url)\n\nraw = file.read()\n```\n\nThis file is in bytes, so we need to decode it into a string. In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\ndon = raw.decode()\n```\n\nNow let's check on what kind of object we have in the \"don\" variable. Type:\n\n```python\ntype(don)\n```\n\nThis should be a string. Great! We have just read in our first file.\n\n# Make Your Own Corpus (continued)\n\nNow we are going to transform that string into a text that we can perform NLTK functions on. Since we already imported nltk at the beginning of our program, we don't need to import it again, we can just use its functions by specifying `nltk` before the function. The first step is to tokenize the words, transforming the giant string into a list of words. A simple way to do this would be to split on spaces, and that would probably be fine, but we are going to use the NLTK tokenizer to ensure that edge cases are captured (i.e., \"don't\" is made into 2 words: \"do\" and \"n't\"). In the next cell, type:\n\n```python\ndon_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(don)\n```\n\nYou can check out the type of `don_tokens` using the `type()` function to make sure it worked—it should be a list. Let's see how many words there are in our novel:\n\n```python\nlen(don_tokens)\n```\n\nSince this is a list, we can look at any slice of it that we want. Let's inspect the first ten words:\n\n```python\ndon_tokens[:10]\n```\n\nThat looks like metadata—not what we want to analyze. We will strip this off before proceeding. If you were doing this to many texts, you would want to use [Regular Expressions](https://regexone.com/). Regular Expressions are an extremely powerful way to match text in a document. However, we are just using this text, so we could either guess, or cut and paste the text into a text reader and identify the position of the first content (i.e., how many words in is the first word). That is the route we are going to take. We found that the content begins at word 320, so let's make a slice of the text from word position 320 to the end.\n\n```python\ndq_text = don_tokens[320:]\n```\n\nNow print the first 30 words to see if it worked:\n\n```python\nprint(dq_text[:30]\n```\n\nFinally, if we want to use the NLTK specific functions:\n\n- `concordance`\n- `similar`\n- `dispersion_plot`\n- or others from the [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/)\n\nwe would have to make a specific NLTK `Text` object.\n\n```python\ndq_nltk_text = nltk.Text(dq_text)\n```\n\nAnd we could check that it worked by running:\n\n```python\ntype(dq_nltk_text)\n```\n\nBut if we only need to use the built-in Python functions, we can just stick with our list of words in `dq_text`.\n\n## Challenge\n\nUsing the `dq_text` variable:\n\n- Remove the stop words\n- Remove punctuation\n- Remove capitalization\n- Lemmatize the words\n\nIf you want to spice your challenge up, do the first three operations _in a single if statement_. Google \"python nested if statements\" for examples.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Lowercase, remove punctuation and stop words:\n\n    ```python\n    dq_clean = []\n    for word in dq_text:\n        if word.isalpha():\n            if word.lower() not in stops:\n                dq_clean.append(word.lower())\n    print(dq_clean[:50])\n    ```\n\n2. Lemmatize:\n\n    ```python\n    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n    wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n\n    dq_lemmatized = []\n    for t in dq_clean:\n        dq_lemmatized.append(wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(t))\n    ```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\n- `urlopen` can save the contents of a webpage into a variable.*\n- To use NLTK functions on a string, we can transform it into a NLTK Text object.*\n- NLTK let's you tokenize (split) a giant string into a list of substrings, considering punctuations and edge cases like `don't`.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [Metadata](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/metadata.md)\n- [Regular Expressions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/regular-expressions.md)\n\n# Part-of-Speech Tagging\n\n_Note that we are going to use the pre-cleaned, `dq_text` object for this section._\n\nPOS (Part-of-Speech) tagging is going through a text and identifying which part of speech each word belongs to (i.e., Noun, Verb, or Adjective). Every word belongs to a part of speech, but some words can be confusing.\n\n- Floyd is happy.\n- Happy is a state of being.\n- Happy has five letters.\n- I'm going to Happy Cat tonight.\n\nTherefore, part of speech is as much related to the word itself as its relationship to the words around it. A good part-of-speech tagger takes this into account, but there are some impossible cases as well:\n\n- Wanda was entertaining last night.\n\nPart of Speech tagging can be done very simply: with a very small _tag set_, or in a very complex way: with a much more elaborate tag set. We are going to implement a compromise, and use a neither small nor large tag set, the [Penn Tree Bank POS Tag Set](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html).\n\nThis is the tag set that is pre-loaded into NLTK. When we call the tagger, we expect it to return an object with the word and the tag associated. Because POS tagging is dependent upon the stop words, we have to use a text that includes the stop words. Therefore, we will go back to using the `dq_text` object for this section. Let's try it out. Type:\n\n```python\ndq_tagged = nltk.pos_tag(dq_text)\n```\n\nLet's inspect what we have:\n\n```python\nprint(dq_tagged[:10])\n```\n\nThis is a list of ordered _tuples_. The Python native type _tuple_ is similar to a list, but can't be changed once it is created. They are also denoted with parentheses, rather than square brackets. Each element in the list is a tuple—or a pairing—consisting of `(word, POS-tag)`. This is great, but it is very detailed. I would like to know how many nouns, verbs, and adjectives I have.\n\nFirst, I'll make an empty dictionary to hold my results. (If you don't know what a dictionary is and how they work, you can check a quick explanation [here](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/).) After that, I will go through this list of tuples and count the number of times each tag appears. Every time I encounter a new tag, I'll add it to a dictionary and then increment by one every time I encounter that tag again. Let's see what that looks like in code:\n\n```python\ntag_dict = {}\n\n# For every word/tag pair in my list,\nfor (word, tag) in dq_tagged:\n    if tag in tag_dict:\n        tag_dict[tag]+=1\n    else:\n        tag_dict[tag] = 1\n```\n\nNow let's see what we got:\n\n```python\ntag_dict\n```\n\nThis would be better with some order to it, but dictionaries are made to be unordered. When we google \"sort dictionaries python\" we find a solution in our great friend [_Stack Overflow_](https://stackoverflow.com/a/613218). Even though we cannot sort a dictionary, we can get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted.\n\nDon't worry too much about understanding the following code, as it uses functions and methods we have not discussed, and are out of the scope of this course. It is useful to learn to reuse pieces of code even when we don't fully understand them.\n\nNow let's do it and find out what the most common tag is.\n\n```python\ntag_dict_sorted = sorted(tag_dict.items(),\n\t\t\t reverse=True,\n\t\t\t key=lambda kv: kv[1])\n```\n\nNow let's check out what we have:\n\n```python\nprint(tag_dict_sorted)\n```\n\nYour result should show that NN is the most common tag. We can look up what NN means in the [Penn Tree Bank](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html). Looks like NN is a Noun, singular or mass. Great! This information will likely help us with genre classification, or identifying the author of a text, or a variety of other functions.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWhich of the following are correct?\n\n- POS tagging does not work well with stop words, therefore you should always clean your text from stop words before using it.\n- Tuples are like lists, but you can't change their value once created.*\n- `nltk.pos_tag` returns tuples of two values, the first being the word, and the second the tag.*\n\n## Keywords\n\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\n\n- [part-of-speech (POS) tagging](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/part-of-speech.md)\n- [Dictionaries](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/dictionaries.md)\n- [Tuples](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tuples.md)\n","title":"Text Analysis Workshop","excerpt":"Digital technologies have made vast amounts of text available to researchers, and this same technological moment has provided us with the capacity to analyze that text faster than humanly possible.

We will be installing it on our local machine and live on the hard drive on your laptop. \n\nNote that Git is a separate software than GitHub. Alternatively, GitHub is a web-based software that lives on the Internet. You can create an account at [github.com](https://github.com).\n\nThese instructions are for Git, not GitHub.\n\n## Why we use it\n\nFor the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use Git because it is an open-source tool that was built to support individual version control needs as well as collaborations across time and space. In our curriculum, it is one of the foundational tools we teach because through understanding how Git works, we learn a lot more about how computers and different softwares work.\n\n## Installation instructions: macOS Catalina\n\n### Step 1: Open a terminal\n\nThe terminal, also known as command line or bash, is a text interface for interacting with - or talking to - your computer. \n\nThis is different from how we usually interact with our computers. Usually, we use softwares that come with a graphical user interface - GUI, pronounced *gooey* - and we point and click on buttons, or drag and drop things. We might also type, like in Microsoft Word. However, in Word, you're not really talking to your computer until you click \"Save\" and name the file. It's at this point that you're telling your computer to perform a task in relation to the document or file you are creating or working on. \n\nWith Git, we talk to the computer through the terminal, so let's go ahead and open that now.\n\nTo open the terminal, open spotlight search (default way to do this is by hitting command and the space bar) and type in “terminal”. Select the application called terminal and press the return key. This should open up an app with a black background. When you see your username followed by a dollar sign, you’re ready to start using command line.\n\n![Image shows terminal, a black box in which you can enter text to interact with your computer.

This give Mac users many commonly used tools, utilities, and compilers, including make, GCC, clang, perl, svn, size, strip, strings, libtool, cpp, what--and Git.\n\nInstall this package by typing the following command into your terminal and clicking enter.\n\n```bash\n$ xcode-select --install\n```\n\n![Image shows terminal with the above command typed in.](/images/guides/commandlinetools.png)\n\n### Step 2: Test the Install\n\nNow, let's make sure Git has been installed successfully. \n\n- Type the following command into the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ git\n```\n\nThe terminal should print something like (note that this is truncated):\n\n```bash\nusage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]\n           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]\n           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]\n           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]\n           <command> [<args>]\n\n\n```\n\n[shows terminal on mac osx](/images/guides/osxterminalgit.png) \n\n## Installation instructions: Microsoft Windows 10\n\n### Step 1: Download Git for Windows\n\nFirst, go to this website: https://git-scm.com/download/win\n\nFrom the option, select \"Click here to download manually\" and save the file. \n\n![Image shows webpage with downloads and circles the desired option](/images/guides/windowsdlgit.png)\n\n### Step 2: *Click* on the git installer:\n\n![git installation icon, looks like a tree branch inside 4 colored squares](/images/guides/git00.png)\n\n### Step 3: Accept the license and *click* `Next`:\n\n ![license acceptance window](/images/guides/git01.png)\n\n### Step 4: Select the installation folder:\n\nThe default folder should be fine. *Click* `Next`.\n\n![installation folder browser with text window showing folder path](/images/guides/git02.png)\n\n### Step 5: Select the components to be installed: \n\nAgain, the default is fine here.\n\n![list of check boxes showing install options: additional icons, on the desktop, Windows Explorer integration, Git Bash, Git GUI, Git LFS, Associate *.git configuration files with the default text editor, associate .sh files to be run with bash,  use a true type font in all console windows, check daily for git for windows, check daily for git console updates](/images/guides/git03.png)\n\n- Windows Only: select start menu folder (default is fine):\n\n![textbox with browse button listing start menu folder options](/images/guides/git04.png)\n\n### Step 6: Choose the default editor used by Git. \n\nSelect `Visual Studio Code` as the default editor.

It is used for Python programs that work with text in statistical natural language processing (NLP). In plain terms, NLTK allows users to work with collections of text to clean, categorize, and analyze that text. As such, it is an excellent tool for text analysis.\n\nATTENTION: NLTK comes installed with the [conda](conda.md) package management system and may already be installed in your environment.\n\n## Why we use it\n\nFor the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use NLTK because it is a rich library of natural language processing tools and datasets. It works very well with Python, allowing users to write powerful natural language processing programs with relatively short sections of code. \n\n## Installation instructions: macOS Catalina\n\nBefore getting started, there are some things to note about software versions. First, these installation instructions work with recent versions of Mac OS X, like Catalina, Mojave, High Sierra, and they *should* work with older versions as well. \n\nSecond, if you have completed the Python workshop, you have probably downloaded the Anaconda package. Therefore, you may already have NLTK installed on your computer. The below instructions begin with an NLTK check and, in the case that you do not have NLTK installed, walk you through the installation.\n\nFinally, NLTK requires Python versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8. The most recent Anaconda installation (which you downloaded for the Python workshop) comes with Python 3.8, so you should already have the relevant version of Python.\n\n### Step 1: Checking if NLTK is already installed\n\nOpen an OSX terminal and type `python` to launch a Python interpreter. You should get something like this:\n\n![image of starting python interpreter](/images/guides/nltk_mac_1.png)\n\nLoad NLTK by typing the following in your environment and *pressing* 'enter':\n\n![image of importing nltk](/images/guides/nltk_mac_2.png)\n\nIf this step fails, you will get an error, and you should  follow the next step, Install NLTK. If it is already installed, nothing will happen and you'll see the three `>>>` in the window. In that case, skip to Step 3, [Install NLTK Data](#step-3:-install-nltk-data-with-the-gui-(mac)).\n\n### Step 2: Install NLTK (MAC)\n\nExit the Python interpreter (`control-d` or `quit()`. Once you're back in your terminal, type:\n\n```console\n$ conda install nltk -y\n```\n\nWhen you press enter, the terminal should look something like the following:\n\n![image of installing nltk](/images/guides/nltk_mac_3.png)\n\nWhen it's finished, go back into the Python interpreter to import NLTK, typing `import NLTK` after the `>>>`. If it downloaded correctly, nothing will happen and you'll see the three `>>>` in the window.  In that case, continue to step 3.\n\n### Step 3: Install NLTK Data with the GUI (MAC)\n\nYou then need to install the data that NLTK relies on to function. This may take several minutes (depending on your internet connection). Some packages may fail installation due to being outdated - this is alright, and will not be a problem for our lessons. If you get an error about a package failing, just shut down the install and skip to [installing NLTK with the command line](#step-4:-install-nltk-data-with-the-command-line-(mac)).\n\nIn your Python environment run the following command *after* import nltk:\n\n```pycon\n>>> nltk.download()\n```\n\nFor example, the interpreter above would now look like:\n\n![image of downloading nltk on interpreter](/images/guides/nltk_mac_4.png)\n\nThe Python environment that the GUI was launched from should now have a message that looks something like this:\n\n```pycon\nshowing info https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/index.xml\n``` \n\nNow, look for the NLTK download GUI - this will appear automatically but may appear hidden behind your browser window or behind where you are working in Python.\n\n![NLTK downloader interface with four tabs: collections, corpora, models, all packages](/images/guides/nltk_downloader.png)\n\nClick on the first tab (collections), and on the first record on that tab: all. Then, click the \"download\" button on the left hand side of that window.\n\nThis may take several minutes (depending on your internet connection). *Press* the refresh button if the install is stalling and ignore errors.\n\nIf something goes wrong, proceed to [installing NLTK with the command line](#step-4:-install-nltk-data-with-the-command-line). If nothing happens, then skip to the [install test](#step-5:-test-installation-(mac)).\n\n### Step 4: Install NLTK Data with the Command Line (MAC)\n\nNLTK also provides a text based download tool, which you can download with the Command Line.\n\nIn your interactive Python environment, type the following commands after importing nltk\n\n```pycon\nnltk.download('all', halt_on_error=False)\n```\n\nThe interpreter above should now look something like:\n\n![image of entering nltk data download command on command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_5.png)\n\nIf the command is successful, the terminal will print out something like:\n\n![image of downloading nltk data on command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_6.png)\n\nIt will take a few minutes to download. At the end, your terminal should look like this, bringing you back to the python interpreter prompt:\n\n![image of completing the nltk data download on command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_7.png)\n\n### Step 5: Test Installation (MAC)\n\nWhen the installation is complete, close the NLTK Downloader and check your installation. You need to be in a Python environment such as an interpreter or Jupyter notebook.\n\n**Brown**\n\nIn your Python environment, run the following code:\n\n```pycon\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\n``` \n\nIf your code runs and nothing happens (no error message and nothing printed to the screen), congratulations! \n\n***Book**\n\nCheck that the books corpus installed properly by typing:\n\n```pycon\nfrom nltk.book import *\n```\n\nIf installed successfully, you should see the following:\n\n![images of nltk books imported into command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_8.png)\n\n**Penn Parts of speech**\n\nCheck that the parts of speech tagger is installed correctly by typing the following:\n\n```pycon\nnltk.help.upenn_tagset('NN')\n```\n\nIf installed successfully, you should see the following:\n\n![image of nltk Part of Speech tagger installed into command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_9.png)\n\n---\n\n## Installation instructions: Microsoft Windows 10\n\nBefore getting started, there are some things to note about software versions.

It provides a Python programming environment, the Jupyter notebook environment, and the conda package management system. \n\n## Why we use it\n\nFor the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we are choosing to use and download Anaconda as it allow us to get all the required software for this institute (python, conda, and the Jupyter notebook environment) in a single download. Anaconda also includes many useful packages for machine learning, and data analysis that will be helpful should you choose to go further in your Python journey!. \n\n## Before we begin...\n\nLet's check if you have Anaconda already installed on your computer.\n\nTry to open the Anaconda Prompt (On Mac, click on the \"magnifying glass\" icon (also known as Spotlight) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar and type `Anaconda`. On Windows, press the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key and type `Anaconda`). If no option comes up, you most likely don't have it installed.\n\nIf you don't have Anaconda installed on your computer, you can follow either the macOS Catalina or Windows instructions. If you do have Anaconda and only need to update Anaconda to the newest version for this workshop, you can go to our Insight section for [Keeping your Anaconda installation up to date](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/insights/blob/v2.0/pages/anaconda.md).\n\n## Installation instructions: macOS (Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur etc.)\n\nWhile the installation instructions below is for macOS Catalina (10.15) and above, this installation instruction should work for older macOS versions. Older macOS versions (10.13 (High Sierra) to 10.14 (Mojave)) can also skip step 3 in the installation process. For older versions, please check out the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#old-os). You can check your macOS version by clicking the \"apple\" icon on the upper-left corner of your menu bar and choose \"About This Mac.\" You should see the macOS name followed by the version number. Should you run into any trouble, you can also find solution to common installation issues [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/).\n\nAnother note, for MacOS Catalina and Big Sur, the Terminal window will likely show the `%` (percent sign) prompt, which is default for the newest version of Terminal. If you have an older version, it will show the `$` (dollar sign) prompt. Either prompt works the exact same, so it does not matter if yours is different from the instructions. Just be aware that they are interchangeable in these instructions.\n \n### Step 1: Download Python 3.+\n\nVisit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your internet browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and scroll to the bottom of the page. Here, click on the **64-Bit Graphical Installer** under the MacOS Python 3.+ version menu. Our screenshot below shows python 3.8, but any latest **python 3.+** version will work with our instructions and the institute.  \n\n![Screenshot: Anaconda download webpage with 3.8 button highlighted](/images/guides/conda_installer_mac.png)\n\nYou can ignore this. Just close this screen.  \n\n![Screenshot: Anaconda thank you image](/images/guides/anaconda01.png)\n\nYou can either let your browser open with the Installer, or save it and open it yourself.\n\n### Step 2: Run Anaconda Installer\n\nAfter the download has completed, if it doesn't open automatically, double-click on the installer file you just saved on your computer. Click `Continue`:  \n\n![Screenshot: Anaconda installer: security image](/images/guides/anaconda02-5.png)\n\nYou should then see the initial install screen. Click `Continue`:  \n \n ![Screenshot: initial installation image](/images/guides/anaconda03.png)\n\nClick `Continue` again:  \n\n![Screenshot: software licence agreement image](/images/guides/anaconda04.png)\n\nAccept the license by clicking `I Agree`:  \n \n![Screenshot: licence agreement](/images/guides/anaconda05.png)\n\nClick `Install`. Only change the install location if you know what you are doing:  \n\n![Screenshot: standard install on macintosh](/images/guides/anaconda06.png)\n\nClick `Install Microsoft VSCode`. If it is already installed, click `Continue`:  \n\n![Screenshot: menu option to also install vscode](/images/guides/anaconda08.png)\n\nThis is the final installation window. Just click `Close`:  \n\n![Screenshot: final installation window for anaconda](/images/guides/anaconda09.png)\n\nYou can move the installer to the Trash to save space on your hard drive by clicking `Move to Trash`:  \n\n![Screenshot: move to trash image](/images/guides/anaconda10.png)\n\n### Step 3: Run conda from your terminal\n\n**NOTE: this step only applies to MacOS Catalina and Big Sur. For all previous version of MacOS, skip to Step 4**\n\nThis step ensures that you will be able to run anaconda directly from your terminal.  \n\nOpen your macOS terminal. You can find your terminal by clicking the \"magnifying glass\" icon (also known as `Spotlight`) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar or press <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>, type `Terminal` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>. In your terminal, you will run a few lines of code to make sure that the terminal knows how to start Anaconda. Type in the following lines of code, after the `%`, pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> after each line:  \n\n```console\ncd ~\nbash\nsource .bash_profile\nconda init zsh\n```\n\nIf this step is successful, when you close and re-open terminal, your command prompt `%` should have (base) in front of it.\n\n### Step 4: Check if Anaconda and Python are successfully installed\n\nOpen the macOS terminal. You can find your terminal by clicking the \"magnifying glass\" icon (also known as Spotlight) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar or press <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>, type `Terminal` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>. In your terminal, type `python` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>. The terminal should print something like:\n\n```console\n~$ python\nPython 3.7.7 (default, May  6 2020, 04:59:01) \n[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> \n```\n\nType `exit()` to leave Python.\n\n### Step 5: Ensure Anaconda Is Up-to-Date\n\nNow that Anaconda is installed, you need to ensure that Anaconda is updated to the newest version for this workshop. Go to our Insight section for [Keeping your Anaconda installation up to date](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/insights/blob/v2.0/pages/anaconda.md) to learn more about how to keep your Anaconda installation up-to-date.\n\n## Installation instructions: Microsoft Windows 10\n\nWhile the installation instructions below is for Windows 10, this installation instruction should work for Windows 8 as well. For older version, please check out the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#old-os). Should you run into any trouble, you can also find solution to common installation issues [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/).\n\n### Step 1: Download Python 3.+:\n\nWe **strongly** recommend that you follow the screens below step by step. Paying particular attention to Step 3 in the installation process.\n\nVisit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your internet browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and scroll to the bottom of the page. Here, click on the **64-Bit Graphical Installer** under the Windows Python 3.+ menu. Our screenshot below shows python 3.8, but any latest **python 3.+** version will work with our instructions and the institute.\n\n![Screenshot: Anaconda download webpage with 3.8 button highlighted](/images/guides/conda_installer_windows.png)\n\nYou can ignore this. Just close this screen and wait for your donwload to finish.\n\n![Screenshot: Anaconda thank you for downloading](/images/guides/anaconda01w.png)\n\n### Step 2: Run Anaconda Installer\n\nAfter the download has completed, if it doesn't open automatically, double-click on the installer file you just saved on your computer.

Whether you want to test short code snippets or document your computational output and complement it with text and multimedia resources in a single document, Jupyter Notebooks is a great tool to use. Here are our short introduction to how to use Notebooks.\n\n## What are Notebooks?\n\nJupyter Notebooks is a form of \"computational notebook\" (sometimes called \"Notebook Interfaces\"). They have existed for decades, and were created to let users to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. They became popular among researchers for allowing them to annotate procedure, data and findings, making it easier for them to later reproduce calculations with different data.\n\nJupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity in the past years, becoming by far the most used computational notebook.\n\n## How to open a Jupyter notebook\n\nIf you have not already installed Anaconda, please do so. Jupyter Notebook comes with Anaconda by default.\n\nFind and open the Anaconda Navigator on your computer (you should be able to find it in the folder with your other applications). From Anaconda Navigator's interface, launch a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n![jupyter](/images/guides/jupyter.png)\n\nJupyter Notebook will open as a tab in your default browser, which is where you will be working. All of the directories (folders) in your `home` directory will appear. (This may vary depending on what operating system—macOS, Windows, etc.—you are using, as the file structure can be different)\n\nWe will now open a new file. It is very important that you make sure to open the file in the right place, so you can find it later. Navigate on the directories clicking on them until you are on the desired directory.\n\nOnce you are in the right place, select `New` >> `Python3` in the upper right corner.\n\n![jupyter notebook \"open new file\" screen](/images/guides/jupyter1.png)\n\nA blank page with an empty box should appear.\n\n![empty box on jupyter notebook new file](/images/guides/jupyter2.png)\n\n## Running a cell\n\nJupyter Notebook allows you to write and run codes in containers, which we call cells. We won't go deep into how it works since it can get a bit complicated. For the moment, it is enough to know that we can run and see the output of the lines of code that are inside a cell.\n\nTo try, type some python code. You can try the classic `print(\"hello world!\")` or anything else you want. To run the cell, press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>. That will give you an output, and create a new cell below.\n\n## Choosing, Starting, and Restarting a kernel\n\nYour notebook has a kernel, which is like an engine that executes the code contained in the cells. Again, we won't go too deep on this right now.\n\nWhat matters is to understand that while you are running codes in a notebook, the kernel will remember all the variables you've created, libraries you've imported, etc. And that will be true even if deleted a cell after you ran it.\n\nThis is very powerful, but can be a source of confusion. If you feel you have changed things too much, or that you are getting outputs you should not be getting, or if you experience some kind of crash, you can always restart the kernel, which will \"clean\" the memory of the kernel, and ask the notebook to run all the cells again. In that way, you will guarantee that the kernel will only have ran what is currently coded on the cells. To do that, on the top menu, click on `kernel` -> `Restart & Run All`. You will see other options there, feel free to explore them.\n\nJupyter Notebook allows you to run cells in any order you want. Again, that can be very useful, but it can be quite confusing. At least in the beginning, we strongly suggest you to avoid running cells out of order.\n\n## Learning more/Resources\n\nThe best way to learn Jupyter Notebook is working with it for a while. Once you get more comfortable, make sure to read tutorials to see advanced possibilities. We suggest some below.\n\nAlso, it is a good idea to try to learn the keyboard shortcuts. They can save you a lot of time in the long run. To see the list of shortcuts, in the top menu click on `Help` >> `Keyboard Shortcuts`.\n\nHere are a few that I have found helpful:\n\n-   [28 Jupyter Notebook Tips, Tricks and Shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/)\n-   [Corey Schafer's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)\n-   DataQuest's [Jupyter Notebook for Beginners: A Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial)\n-   Programming Historian's [longer tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks)","title":"Short Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks","excerpt":"Jupyter Notebooks!","cover_image":"/images/img3.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
